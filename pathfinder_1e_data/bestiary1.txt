    Mucus Cloud (Ex) 
      While underwater, an aboleth exudes a cloud of transparent slime. All creatures adjacent to an aboleth must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 3 hours. Renewed contact with an aboleth’s mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
    Slime (Ex) 
      A creature hit by an aboleth’s tentacle must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or his skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature’s new “flesh” is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as it persists. If the creature’s flesh isn’t kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.

focus on combat and the destruction of evil; though they

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spells 
Solars can cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
Slaying Arrow (Su) A solar’s bow needs no ammunition, and automatically creates a slaying arrow of the solar’s choice when drawn.
Solars are the greatest type of angel, usually serving at the right hand of a deity or championing a cause that benefits an entire world or plane. 
A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Blessed with an array of magical powers and the 
spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars 
are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying 
mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the 
celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able 
to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend f lying through the 
Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers 
and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, 
night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making 
forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane 
to destroy these creatures at their source before they can 
bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded 
at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that 
are now extinct by the solar’s hand.
Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental 
supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great

skin, and three pairs of white wings.

importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the 
energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil 
races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal 
darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven 
mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison 
demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a f laming sword 
stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no 
creature may enter.
In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they 
send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending 
to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow 
to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed 
by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the 
downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be 
martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to 
land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be.
Though they are not gods, the solars’ power approaches 
that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role 
for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic 
faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or 
near-equal servants of the true deities—never without 
the deity’s approval—or consider notable solars to be 
offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities 
(which they may be, depending on the deity).
Unlike other angels, most solars are created from 
an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to 
directly serve the gods, but an increasing number 
of these powerful angels have been “promoted” 
to their existence as solars from lesser 
creatures like planetars or devas. A few 
rare and powerful good souls ascend 
directly to the status of solar. The 
oldest solars predate mortality 
and are among the gods’ first 
creations. These strange solars 
are paragons of their kind and 
have little direct interaction with 
mortals, focusing on the protection 
or destruction of abstract concepts 
such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, 
and primordial evil.
Solars who spend a long time in 
the Material Plane, especially those in 
the guise of mortals, are sometimes the 
source of half-celestial or aasimar bloodlines 
in mortal families, due either to romantic 
dalliances or simply the mortals’ proximity 
to celestial energy. Actual offspring are 
rare, and when they occur, it is always a 
mortal mother that bears the child—
while solars can appear as either sex, 
the gods have not granted them the 
capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this 

fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out 
a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is 
generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely 
interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to 
avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities. 
Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and 
in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to 
aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and 
mysterious ways.
 All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and 
though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they 
sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, 
acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against 
the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spit Acid (Ex) Once every 6 hours, an ankheg can spit a 
30-foot line of acid. Creatures struck by this acid take 
4d4 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 14 halves). Once 
an ankheg uses this attack, it must wait 6 hours before 
using it again. Additionally, during this time period, its 
bite attack does not inflict any additional acid damage. 
As a result, an ankheg does not use this ability unless it 
is desperate or frustrated, most often spitting acid when 
reduced to fewer than half its full normal hit points or 
when it cannot not successfully grab an opponent. The 
save DC is Constitution-based.
Ankhegs are an all-too-common plague upon the rural 
areas of the world. These horse-sized burrowing monsters 
generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but their 
predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh ensures 
that they do not keep to the deep wilderness either. Their 
preferred habitat is rural farmlands, as the loose soil of such 
regions makes it easy for the creatures to burrow. Tales 
speak of larger ankhegs that dwell in remote deserts—
such creatures likely feed primarily on giant scorpions 
and camels, and rarely come in contact with 
civilization due to their remote locations. (A 
desert ankheg is a Huge advanced ankheg.)

Cling (Ex) If a creature leaves an army ant swarm’s square, 
the swarm suffers 1d6 points of damage to reflect the loss 
of its numbers as several of the crawling pests continue 
to cling tenaciously to the victim. A creature with army 
ants clinging to him takes 3d6 points of damage at the 
end of his turn each round. As a full-round action, he can 
remove the ants with a DC 17 Reflex save. High wind or 
any amount of damage from an area effect destroys all 
clinging ants. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Consume (Ex) An army ant swarm can rapidly consume  
any creature it swarms over. Against helpless or nauseated 
targets, an army ant swarm attack deals 6d6 points  
of damage.

Archon
Archons are a race of outsiders from Heaven, creatures of 
fundamental law and good tasked with the protection of 
that plane as well as all who are innocent or free of evil. 
They are the natural enemies of devils, daemons, and 
demons, and most are veterans of many attacks against 
their home by fiends of the Lower Planes.
The natives of Heaven arise from amid the earth and 
clouds of that divine realm, inspired into creation by the 
sacred mountain’s metaphysical processes, the faith of goodly 
mortals, and the transformation of virtuous spirits. Each 
archon begins life as a lantern archon or lesser servitor spirit, 
gaining in power and prestige through aiding the cause of 
good. Watched over by benevolent mentors and captains of 
the divine orders, each spirit is encouraged and aided in 
indulging its fundamental desire to see peace, honesty, and 
fairness spread across all lands, especially throughout the 
Material Plane. To this end, archons of all walks often take 
on the roles of questing knights, journeying throughout 
disparate worlds and realms aiding in good works and 
promoting courageous acts. These virtuous outsiders prefer 
to motivate mortals to act with honor and integrity rather 
than righting mortal wrongs themselves, believing the cause 
of righteousness is best served by enlightening creatures to 
make just choices and cast off their own shackles of evil. 
This makes future temptations easier to resist and plants 
the seeds of spiritual deliverance. Thus, most archons take 
a subtle hand in their interactions with mortals, taking 
special pleasure in bringing solace and reprieve to those 
who are wholly unaware of their presence.
The efforts of Heaven prove far less subtle when it 
comes to combating the hordes of the Lower Planes. 
Armies of archons stand in staunch opposition to the 
affronts of Hell, Abaddon, and the Abyss, confronting 
them upon both extraplanar battlefields and the Material 
Plane itself. These encounters might take the form of vast 
armies clashing over strange planar holdings, or solitary 
archons revealing themselves upon mortal worlds to 
push back the machinations of fiendish invaders. In such 
cases, archons generally prefer to meet foes head-on if it is 
prudent to do so, but if outmatched, they do what they can 
to even the odds (usually by employing hit-and-run tactics 
or standing off and engaging a foe with magic before 
moving into melee). Because they can teleport at will, it 
is easy for them to vanish only to reappear later, often 
with reinforcements, when their enemies are unprepared. 
These warriors of law act honorably, even to their foes, 
but are not foolish or without passion, and little in the 
multiverse dares stand against the rage of Heaven.
Although archons are champions of good, they have little 
patience for those who do not follow strict traditions and 
patterns of goodness. While a cruel dictatorship might be 

a legitimate enemy of the archon, rebellion and riot is not 
the proper way to address such an inequality. Justice and law 
must not be abandoned in the constant struggle for peace 
and good, for in such anarchic actions one often promotes 
further harm and mayhem, even if unintentionally. The 
laws of Heaven exist to minimize collateral damage and 
unwanted pain, and while adhering to these laws often 
results in longer campaigns, archons point out that their 
victories are lasting triumphs as a result. Because of this 
strong adherence to tradition and law, archons often find 
themselves the unwilling enemies of chaotic good creatures, 
particularly the azatas. To an archon, an azata’s nature seems 
whimsical and impatient—in striking swiftly against an 
enemy without bothering to think through the implications 
of their sudden act, it’s possible to do more harm than good. 
Still, while opposing the chaos of an azata is a necessary step, 
the archon takes no pleasure in such opposition, and does its 
best to minimize the length of such a conflict. Unfortunately, 
the capricious and emotional azatas are legendary among the 
archons for their ability to hold grudges, so for many archons 
the best policy when interacting with the azatas is to be brief, 
succinct, and firm.
Archons speak Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal, but can 
speak with almost any creature because of their truespeech  
ability. A full list of archon traits is presented on page 311. 
Many archons have additional abilities beyond these traits, 
as befits their particular role in the army of Heaven.

Archon Empyreal Lords
Numerous powerful archons number among the empyreal 
lords, benevolent heroes of goodness and rulers over 
sacred realms. Having ascended beyond the specific forms 
of their kindred, these unique archons spread the peace of 
righteousness and order, either through subtle acts or at the 
forefront of divine armies, and war against all who would 
corrupt that which is just. The following is but a selection of 
some of the most venerated archon empyreal lords.

it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include 
any dog-like or wolf-like creature of the animal type.

wolves or dogs. Well trained, they prefer to make

SPECIAL ABILITIES
gestalt (Su) Nine lantern archons can fuse together as a 
full-round action, becoming a single Large entity that is 
more powerful than the individual archons that make up 
its parts. Looking like a whirlwind of dancing firefly lights, 
the gestalt has all the powers and abilities of a Large air 
elemental plus the following: archon, good, and lawful 
subtypes; archon traits (aura of menace DC 16); 2 light 
rays (2d6); DR 5/evil and magic. The archons can remain 
in this form for 2d4 rounds. When the gestalt separates 
back into individual lantern archons, its remaining hit 
points are divided evenly among them; if it had less than 9 
hit points, some of the component archons die when the 
gestalt ends.

Light Ray (Ex) A lantern archon can fire beams of light to 
damage foes. These light rays have a maximum range of 30 
feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.
Friendly and curious beings, lantern archons eagerly 
converse with and assist other creatures. Their bodies, 
however, are merely globes of spiritual purity and 
pale light, and though they might interact with their 
surroundings through pure force of will, such 
interaction proves too weak to help with most physical 
tasks. Their evasive natures make them exceptional at 
scouting—at least in areas where strange lights aren’t 
unusual—relaying messages, and overwhelming enemies 
with surprise and group tactics. Although they appear 
fragile, their forms guard them against all 
but the most profane attacks. 
A lantern archon always glows, 
usually as bright as a torch. They 
have total control over the color 
of light they shed, and take 
great pleasure in modulating 
their colors and brightness 
in time to music or to 
entertain other creatures. 
Most lantern archons 
speak in airy, echoing 
voices, with tones that 
range from somber 
whispers to hurried 
chirping. Often, their 
light f luctuates along 
with their words or tones, 
punctuating their speech 
with sparks of light or gentle 
pulses. As a swift action, a lantern archon 
can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 
round. Only death can extinguish this light. As lantern 
archons never sleep or eat, they make excellent watchers 
and guardians. Lantern archons light many settlements 
in the celestial realms in lieu of mundane or magical 
illumination, serving as disguised sentinels always 
watchful for approaching evil.
Small but fast and zealous, lantern archons make 
excellent support troops in celestial armies, swarming 
over weak opponents or teleporting en masse to 
f lanking positions to cut off reinforcements or escape 
routes. These miniature archons work well together and 
know that there is great strength in numbers, uniting 
in times of need and desperation to form gestalts with 
greater control over their surroundings. Especially brave 
lantern archons might eventually be promoted into 
a more powerful kind of archon, but most are content 
with their status.

Shedding a warm and calming radiance, this orb of light moves 
with a preternatural silence and otherworldly grace.

those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.

Whirlwind Blast (Su) When in wind form, a bralani can 
attack with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of

Constitution-based.
Wind form (Su) A bralani can shift between its humanoid 
body and a body made of wind and mist as a standard 
action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its whirlwind 
blast. In wind form, it functions as if under the effects of a 
wind walk spell. It can make slam attacks and use spell-
like abilities in either form. A bralani remains in one form 
until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form 
cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani revert to any 
particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). 
A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.

gaze (Su) In humanoid form, a ghaele’s gaze attack slays evil 
creatures of 5 HD or less (range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates,

creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must

A creature that saves against a ghaele’s gaze is immune to 
that particular ghaele’s gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-
affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Light form (Su) A ghaele can shift between its solid body and 
one made of light as a standard action. In solid form, it 
cannot fly or use light rays. In light form, it can fly and gains 
the incorporeal quality—it can make light ray attacks or use 
spell-like abilities in this form, but can’t make physical attacks 
or cast spells. This ability otherwise functions similarly to a 
bralani’s wind form ability.
Light Ray (Ex) A ghaele’s light rays 
have a range of 300 feet. This attack 
bypasses all damage reduction.
Spells Ghaeles cast divine spells as 13th-
level clerics. They do not gain access 
to domains or other cleric abilities.
Ghaeles are the most knightly 
of the azatas, hunting fiends, 
dragons, and undead with

smile—and equally quick 
to strike against those 
they perceive as wicked.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
hallucination Cloud (Ex) As a standard action once per 
minute, a basidirond can release a cloud of invisible 
spores in a 20-foot radius. All creatures within the area 
must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be affected by 
powerful hallucinations as long as they remain in the cloud 
plus 1d4 rounds after leaving the area. A new save must be 
made each round a creature remains within the affected 
area. A hallucination cloud persists for 5 rounds before 
dispersing—a strong wind causes it to disperse 
immediately. The save DC is Constitution-based. To 
determine what hallucination is suffered each round, 
roll 1d6 and consult the following table.
d6 hallucination
1 You’re sinking in quicksand! Fall prone and spend 1 
round flailing your arms and legs as if trying to swim.
2 Attacked by a swarm of spiders! Spend a full round 
action to attack the floor near you with your weapon.
3 An item you hold has turned into a viper! Drop it and 
flee from the item at top speed for 1 round.
4 You’re suffocating! Stand in place, hold your 
breath, and clutch at your throat for 1 round.
5 You’ve shrunk to 1/10th your normal size! Take no 
actions for 1 round and monsters won’t see you.
6 You’re melting! Grasp hold of yourself in an attempt to 
hold yourself together, and take no actions for 1 round.

Spores (Ex) Any creature struck by a basidirond’s slam attack 
is coated with spores. The creature struck must make a 
DC 16 Fortitude save or these spores take root in his flesh, 
and particularly in his lungs. The save DC is Constititon-
based.Basidirond Spores: Disease—inhaled; save Fort DC 
16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; 
cure 1 save.
Cold Lethargy (Ex) Although a basidirond is immune to cold 
damage, any cold effect it is exposed to slows it for 1d4 
rounds. During this time, the basidirond cannot use its 
hallucination cloud or spores.
The strange fungal basidirond is a deadly plant monster 
that feeds on mineral-rich moisture, be it runoff from 
cave walls or fresh blood. By ensuring a constant f low 
of nutritious moisture, canny cave dwellers can use 
basidironds as guardians for their lairs, although they 
must take care to avoid the plant’s hunting routes lest 
they become its latest victims.

This strange plant consists of four spidery stalks, long green 
tendrils, and an inverted bell-shaped cap filled with spores.

gaze (Ex) Turn to stone permanently (as flesh to stone), range 
30 feet, Fortitude DC 15 negates. A creature petrified in 
this matter that is then coated (not just splashed) with fresh 
basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk no more than 1 hour 
dead) is instantly restored to flesh. A single basilisk contains 
enough blood to coat 1d3 Medium creatures in this manner. 
The save DC is Constitution-based.
The basilisk, often called the “King of Serpents,” is in 
fact not a serpent at all, but rather an eight-legged reptile 
with a nasty disposition and the ability to turn creatures 
to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like 
the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from eggs 
laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the 
basilisk’s physiology lends any credence to this claim.
Basilisks live in nearly any terrestrial environment, from 
forest to desert, and their hides tend to match and reflect 
their surroundings—a desert-dwelling basilisk might be 
tan or brown, while one that lives in a forest could be 
bright green. They tend to make their lairs in caves, 
burrows, or other sheltered areas, and these dens are 
often marked by statues of people and animals in 
lifelike poses—the petrified remains of 
those unfortunate enough to stumble 
across the basilisk.

The dire bat is usually found lairing in desolate areas, 
resting in caves or other secluded areas during the day 
and taking to the skies in search of prey at night. This 
immense creature has an average wingspan of 15 feet and 
weighs roughly 200 pounds.
The dire bat generally doesn’t 
shelter in groups larger than eight, 
often living a solitary life. A dire 
bat prefers feeding on livestock 
and herd animals.

A large, powerful omnivore, the grizzly bear inhabits 
many of the world’s forested hills. Equally happy 
consuming nuts, berries, fish, or small mammals, the 
grizzly is nonetheless fiercely territorial, 
and will chase off—or, failing that, kill and 
eat—any intruders it views as competition.
When faced with a foe or small group 
of threats, the grizzly attempts to 
subdue or kill with its claws. 
When it can, the bear tries 
to grab a single target to 
deal continual damage 
until that target is 
dead, unconscious,  
or escapes.
To generate stats for a 
smaller bear (like a black 
bear), you can apply the 
young simple template 
to the grizzly bear’s stat 
block. To generate stats for 
a larger grizzly or a polar 
bear, apply the advanced 
simple template to the 
grizzly’s stats.

Larger, more aggressive, and 
far more deadly than its 
lesser cousins, the dire bear 
(known to barbarian tribes 
variously as the cave bear or 
the short-faced bear) is a 
primeval menace indeed. 
This behemoth avoids 
more civilized reaches of 
the world, preferring 
to dwell in remote 
wilderness locations. 
A dire bear is a rare 
and terrifying sight—
especially to those not 
used to normal bears.
Unlike most bears, a dire 
bear is short-tempered and 
swift to anger when confronted 
with intruders in its territory. 
Like a grizzly, a dire bear attempts 
to subdue or kill with its claws. 
However, a dire bear is far more 
likely (and willing) to begin biting a 
grabbed foe.

Broad, powerful muscles move beneath this massive bear’s brown 
fur, promising both speed and lethal force.

Spittle drips from this feral bear’s roaring maw, and its matted fur 
is broken in places by wicked, bony growths.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dismantle Armor (Ex) If a bebilith hits a foe with both claw 
attacks, it can attempt to peel away the target’s armor 
and shield as a free action by making a CMB check. 
If the bebilith is successful, the target’s armor and 
shield are torn from his body and dismantled, 
falling to the ground. Armor subjected to this 
attack loses half its hit points and gains the 
broken condition if the target fails a DC 25 
Reflex save. The save DC is Strength-based.
Penetrating Strike (Su) A bebilith’s natural 
weapons are treated as chaotic and 
magical for the purposes of penetrating 
damage reduction. Against creatures with 
the demon type, its natural weapons are 
also treated as cold iron and good.
Rot (Su) A bebilith’s bite causes a horrible withering and weakening of the flesh, resulting in a hideous melting and foul rotting effect. This catastrophic withering begins on the round the creature is bitten and continues for another 4 rounds thereafter, for 5 rounds of withering in all. Each round the rot persists, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage. If the target makes two consecutive saving throws in a row, the effect is cured. Heal can also halt the rot effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

it relies on its own glowing glands for illumination.

Other variations on the common fire beetle exist. The 
two most common variants are detailed below.
Mining Beetle (CR 1/2): A mining beetle is an

Nearly 10 feet long, giant stag beetles become serious 
dangers when they wander into logging camps due to their 
appetite for decaying wood. Called stag beetles because of 
their large, antler-like mandibles, they use these appendages 
to wrestle competing suitors and quickly 
put down enemy threats.
Variant species of these giant 
beetles exist as well. The two 
detailed below are the ones most 
commonly encountered.
Bombardier Beetle (CR 2): This 
giant stag beetle has only 2 Hit 
Dice and is Medium sized, but can 
spray acid once per round in a 10-foot 
cone. Those in the cone must make 
a DC 11 Fortitude save or take 1d4+2 
points of acid damage. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.
Goliath Beetle (CR 8): 
The immense goliath 
beetle is a Huge 
stag beetle with 
12 HD and 
the trample 
special ability.

This housecat-sized beetle is a dull brown color brightened by two 
glowing green-yellow spots on its carapace.

With a sleek body and huge mandibles raised in a threatening

grab (Ex) A behir’s grab attack works against creatures 
of any size category. It can constrict the same round 
it establishes a hold. On any round thereafter that it 
maintains its hold, the behir can choose to rake the 
grappled target or swallow it whole.
Temperamental and avaricious, the behir spends most 
of its time slithering through the sandy hills and desert 
cliffs that make up its territory, preying upon all creatures 
who dare to enter its hunting grounds. The creature’s six 
pairs of powerful, clawed legs remain folded against 
its sides most of the time, only extending in combat to 
grapple foes or carry the behir forward in a terrifying, 
low-slung gallop, or else when climbing the sheer cliff 
faces common to behir lairs.
The average behir is 40 feet long and weighs 4,000 
pounds. In addition to the two prominent horns on its 
head, many have additional decorative spines at regular

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A black pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves 
organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. 
Each time a creature suffers damage from a black pudding’s 
acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of damage 
from the acid. A DC 21 Reflex save prevents damage to 
clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes 
a black pudding takes 2d6 acid damage unless the weapon’s 
wielder succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a black pudding 
remains in contact with a wooden or metal object for 1 full 
round, it inflicts 21 points of acid damage (no save) to the 
object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Corrosion (Ex) An opponent that is being constricted by a 
black pudding suffers a –4 penalty on Reflex saves made to 
resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.
Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a 
black pudding. Instead, the creature splits into two identical 
puddings, each with half of the original’s current hit points 
(round down). A pudding with 10 hit points or less cannot 
be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.
Suction (Ex) The black pudding can create powerful suction

inverted surfaces with ease. A black pudding can establish 
or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using 

suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a 
black pudding’s CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus 
to resist bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and 
effects that attempt to physically move it from its location.

Much more ill-tempered and dangerous than their 
domesticated kin, boars are omnivorous creatures common 
to temperate forests, although they are not unknown 
in tropical climes. Other variants exist 
as well, such as the particularly ugly 
warthogs that dwell in tropical plains 
and savannahs. Boars are often hunted 
for their f lesh, which is considered 
delicious by most humanoids. Those 
who hunt boars often do so with a 
special spear fitted with a cross 
beam to prevent an impaled boar 
from pushing forward along 
the spear shaft to gore its 
tormentor.
The boar’s stubborn 
nature and habit of eating 
even bones makes it well suited as 
a pet for certain folk. Many thieves’ 
guilds keep boars for the disposal 
of bodies, while orc tribes let them 
run loose in their lairs, where they 
do a relatively good job at keeping 
these warrens clean of refuse.
A boar is four feet long and 
weighs 200 pounds.

Whereas the boar is ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, 
the towering daeodon (known as the dire boar to most 
commoners and hunters) is legitimately hateful and 
violent. Although omnivorous like its smaller 
kin, the daeodon prefers to feed on f lesh, and 
its razor-sharp tusks and keen eyesight 
make it particularly well suited as a 
predator. While the daeodon is 
primarily a scavenger, it isn’t 
averse to attacking smaller 
creatures it encounters 
while searching for easier 
meals, or those who 
stumble unwittingly into 
its territory. Particularly 
brave or skilled orcs are 
fond of using daeodons 
as mounts, and orc 
cavalry mounted on 
dire boars make for a 
fearsome force indeed. A 
typical adult daeodon 
is 10 feet long and 7 feet 
tall at the shoulder. It 
weighs approximately 
2,000 pounds.

This ill-tempered beast’s tiny, bloodshot eyes glare angrily above 
a mouth filled with sharp tusks.

The back of this horse-sized boar rises in a steep slope. Its tiny red 
eyes are crusted with filth and its bristly f lank crawls with f lies.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
hold Breath (Ex) A boggard can hold its breath 
for a number of rounds equal to four times its 
Constitution score before it risks drowning or 
suffocating.
Sticky Tongue (Ex) A creature hit by a boggard’s tongue 
attack cannot move more than 10 feet away from the 
boggard and takes a –2 penalty to AC as long as the 
tongue is attached (this penalty does not stack if multiple 
tongues are attached). The tongue can be removed by 
making an opposed Strength check as a standard action 
or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the tongue 
(AC 11, damage does not deplete the boggard’s actual hit 
points). The boggard cannot move more than 10 feet away 
from the target, but the boggard can release its tongue as 
a free action. Unlike a giant frog, a boggard cannot pull 
targets toward it with its tongue.
Swamp Stride (Ex) A boggard can move through any sort 
of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while 
within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a 
boggard normally.

Terrifying Croak (Su) Once per hour, a boggard can, as a 
standard action, emit a loud and horrifying croak. Any non-
boggard creature within 30 feet of the boggard must make a 
DC 13 Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. Creatures 
that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by the 
same boggard’s croak for 24 hours. Creatures that are already 
shaken become frightened for 1d4 rounds instead. The save 
DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Leap (Ex) A bulette can perform a special kind of pounce attack by 
jumping into combat. When a bulette charges, it can make a 
DC 20 Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land 
next to its enemies. If it makes the Acrobatics check, 
it can follow up with four claw attacks against foes 
in reach, but cannot make a bite attack.
Savage Bite (Ex) A bulette’s bite is particularly 
dangerous. It applies 1-1/2 times its Strength 
modifier to damage inflicted with its bite attack, 
and threatens a critical hit on a 19–20.
The creation of some unknown arcanist in 
millennia past, the bulette has bred true to 
become one of the fiercest predators of the 
hills. Burrowing rapidly through the earth just 
beneath the surface, sometimes with its armored 
fin cutting a distinctive wake behind it, the 
bulette launches itself free of stone and soil to 
tear into its prey without remorse, giving rise to 
the common appellation “landshark.”

Leopards are 4 feet long and weigh 120 pounds. The 
statistics presented here can describe any feline of similar 
size, such as jaguars, panthers, and mountain lions—what 
differentiates these big cats from the similarly sized 
cheetah is primarily their habitats—leopards 
and their kin prefer to hunt at night and 
ambush their prey from above, pouncing 
down from trees or high rocks.
Leopards eat almost any 
animal they can run down 
and catch, preferring Small 
prey but capable of downing 
Large herbivores or 
surviving on rodents, 
birds, and insects. Healthy 
leopards are generally 
not aggressive toward 
humanoids, and if they 
aren’t hungry and don’t 
feel threatened, it is possible 
to approach closely without a 
hostile reaction. Yet a leopard that 
settles in an area bordered by humanoid 
civilization can easily and swiftly 
become a dangerous predator.

filament (Ex) A cave fisher can fire a thin filament of sticky 
silk as a standard action. This touch attack has a range 
of 60 feet and no range increment. A creature struck 
by a cave fisher’s filament becomes attached to the 
sticky thread. As a standard action, a creature can rip 
the filament free with a DC 20 Strength check. A caught 
creature can also attempt to escape a filament by making 
a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament is AC 14 (touch 12), 
has 5 hit points, and has DR 15/slashing. An application 
of liquid with high alcohol content (or a dose of universal 
solvent) dissolves the adhesive and 
releases the creature caught by 
the filament. A cave fisher 
can have only one filament 
active at a time.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a centaur is Large, its upper 
torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a 
result, they wield weapons as if they were one size category 
smaller than their actual size (Medium for most centaurs).
Legendary hunters and skilled warriors, centaurs 
are part man and part horse. Typically found on the 
fringes of civilization, these stoic people vary widely 
in appearance, their skin tones typically appearing 
deeply tanned but similar to the humans who occupy 
nearby regions, while their lower bodies borrow the 
colorations of local equines. Centaur hair and eyes trend 
toward darker colors and their features tend to be broad, 
while the overall bulk of their bodies is influenced by the 
size of the horses their lower quarters resemble. Thus, while 
an average centaur stands over 7 feet tall and weights upward 
of 2,000 pounds, there are vast regional variations—from 
lean plains-runners to burly mountain hunters. Centaurs 
typically live to be about 60 years old.

Giant centipedes attack nearly any living creatures with 
their poisonous jaws. These creatures adapt to many 
environments and feed voraciously on the local fauna,

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Paralytic Tentacles (Ex) A chuul can transfer a grappled victim 
from a claw to its tentacles as a move action. The tentacles 
grapple with the same strength as the claw but deal no 
damage, instead exuding a paralytic secretion. Anyone held 
in the tentacles must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each 
round on the chuul’s turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The 
save DC is Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles, 
paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes 1d8+7 points 
of damage each round from the creature’s mandibles.
Chuuls are armored, crustacean-like predators that 
lurk beneath the surfaces of shallow ponds and 
mires, bursting from concealment to snatch up prey 
in their chitinous pincers and then paralyzing them 
with their mouth tentacles before eating them alive.
Chuuls are excellent swimmers but prefer to attack 
land-bound creatures or those wallowing in shallow 
water. Once they seize their victims, chuuls often drag 
grappled foes back into deep water to drown them. 

Lizardfolk are by far the chuul’s favorite prey, though 
those pale chuul breeds that live underground prefer 
morlocks, duergar, unwary drow, and other unfortunates 
who get too close to their subterranean waterways—with 
the exception of troglodytes, whose f lavor chuuls find 
particularly offensive.
Chuuls are surprisingly intelligent, leading many to 
speculate fruitlessly on their origins and motivations. 
They speak a chittering, burbling dialect of Common, 
but few are inclined to speak to those outside their race, 
and if chuul society exists beyond their frenzied mating 
season, humanoids have yet to record it. Instead, chuul 
intellects seem entirely devoted to seeking out the perfect 
ambush sites to attack other intelligent creatures and 
decorating their elaborate lairs with trophies from their 
kills. Though the chuuls themselves seem uninterested in 
using tools of any kind, they have an almost compulsive 
need to collect keepsakes from their victims.
A typical chuul is 8 feet tall and weighs 650 pounds.

Chuul
This lobster-like creature has a thick armored shell. A pair of tiny 
eyes gleams above a mouth full of writhing tentacles.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium or smaller 
creature in its body as a standard action. The cloaker 
attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack 
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it 
establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim 
with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still use its 
whip-like tail to strike at other targets. Attacks that 
hit an engulfing cloaker deal half their damage to the 
monster and half to the trapped victim.
Moan (Ex) A cloaker can emit an infrasonic moan as a 
standard action, with one of four effects.
Fear: All creatures in a 30-foot spread must 
save (Will negates) or become panicked for 2 rounds.
Nausea: All creatures in a 30-foot cone must save (Fortitude 
negates) or fall prone and be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds.
Stupor: A single creature within 30 feet is affected by hold 
monster for 5 rounds (Will negates).
Unnerve: Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically 
takes a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those 

in the area for more than 6 consecutive rounds must 
save (Will negates) or enter a trance, helpless until the 
moaning stops.
Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mind-affecting 
attacks. A creature that successfully saves against the 
cloaker’s fear, nausea, or unnerve moans cannot be affected 
by that same moan effect from that cloaker for 24 hours. All 
of the save DCs against a cloaker’s moan are DC 15. Save 
DCs are Charisma-based.
Shadow Shift (Su) When in dim illumination, a cloaker can 
manipulate shadows as a free action to create one of three 
effects: blur (lasts 1d4 rounds, self only), mirror image (CL 6th), 
or silent image (DC 15, CL 6th, save DC is Charisma-based).
Resembling hideously evil f lying manta rays, cloakers are 
mysterious and paranoid creatures. A typical specimen 
has an 8-foot wingspan and weighs 100 pounds.
A cloaker’s motives are hidden and confusing, and 
they distrust even their own kind. Their strange shape 
allows them to disguise themselves as a variety of cloaks, 
tapestries, and other mundane objects, and stories linger 
of cloakers that ally with other creatures, hitching a ride 
on their backs and aiding in their ally’s protection for their 
own inscrutable reasons. A rare few are priests of ancient 
gods, leading cults of cloakers and skum to undertake all 
manner of hideous 
rites and working 
toward singularly 
sinister goals.

This ray-like creature opens a toothy maw and leers with glaring 
red eyes. Behind it whips a menacing tail of segmented bone.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Petrification (Su) A cockatrice’s bite causes flesh to calcify and 
harden—multiple bites can cause a living creature to fossilize 
into stone. Each time a creature is damaged by a cockatrice’s 
bite attack, it must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 
1d4 points of Dexterity damage as its flesh and bones stiffen and 
harden. (This slow petrification does not alter a bitten creature’s 
natural armor.) A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by 
a cockatrice’s bites immediately turns completely to stone, 
as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature 
petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new 
DC 12 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification, at 
which point the victim returns to flesh with 1 Dexterity (and 
thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing 
or magic as normal)—but after a petrified creature fails 
three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state 
becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via 
magic has its Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice 
bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity 
damage from other sources. A cockatrice is immune 
to the petrification ability of itself and of other 
cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect 
them normally. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.
Stupid, vicious, and repulsive, 
cockatrices are avoided by other creatures due 
to their magical ability to turn f lesh 

to stone. Legends say that the first cockatrice emerged 
from an egg laid by a cockerel and incubated by a toad. 
Whether or not the story is true, today’s cockatrices breed 
true in terrifying and filthy dens haphazardly excavated by as 
many as a dozen of the squawking creatures. Males greatly 
outnumber females in these f locks, and are distinguished 
only by their wattles and combs. The typical cockatrice 
stands just over 2 feet high and weighs 5 pounds.
While their diet consists primarily of seeds and 
petrified insects (which conveniently double in the 
creature’s gizzard as both gastroliths and nutrition as they 
grind away), cockatrices fiercely defend their territories 
from anything they deem a threat, and the wanderings of 
rogue males seeking new spots to build dens sometimes 
bring them into unintentional contact with humanoids, 
with devastating results. 
The cockatrice’s strange ability to turn other creatures 
to stone is the creature’s greatest defense, and a cockatrice 
lair is invariably littered with petrified remnants of foes. 
In an ironic twist of fate, however, weasels and ferrets—
the creatures most likely to slip into cockatrices’ nests and 
consume their eggs—appear to be completely immune 
to the effect. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both 
terrified of and enraged by conventional roosters, and are 
equally likely to f lee or attack when confronted by one.

Couatl
This great serpent has multicolored wings and eyes that glimmer 
with intense awareness.

CCoocckkaattrriicce–Couatl

e–Couatl

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spells A couatl casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer, and can cast 
spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available 
to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for 
a couatl, meaning that the creature does not need a divine 
focus to cast them.
Poison (Ex) Injury—bite; save Fortitude DC 16; frequency 1/
minute for 10 minutes; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive 
saves. The DC is Constitution-based.
Couatls are servants of lawful and good deities, though 
some operate independently of any greater being. Respected 
and admired for their wisdom and beauty, they try to steer 
mortals onto the right path and use their powers to fight 
evil, particularly those known to shift between the planes. 
Some couatls are viewed as benevolent gods by isolated 
societies, and while most couatls cringe at the thought of 
pretending to be a god, they allow such misconceptions 
to continue since they allow the couatls to guide and 
coax these societies onto paths of peace and cooperation 
with their neighbors. A couatl is about 12 feet long, with a 
wingspan of about 15 feet. It weighs 1,800 pounds.
As native outsiders, couatls must eat. They prefer the 
same foods as true snakes, such as mammals 
and birds, though they have been 
known to eat evil humanoids.

As they would rather 
spend their time promoting 
their agenda than hunting, couatls 
appreciate offers of food, particularly 
small boars and large game fowl.
A couatl sometimes shows its favor to 
an adventurer or party that has done it a service by 
gifting the group with 1d4 of its brightly colored feathers. 
Such a freely given feather, if used as an additional 
material component, allows a spellcaster to cast planar 
ally to conjure that specific couatl without 
expending the typical payment of gold 
or other valuables—provided the the 
couatl approves of the service asked 
for by the spellcaster. 49

Water Dependency (Ex) Giant crabs can survive out of the 
water for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this 
limit, a giant crab runs the risk of suffocation, as if it 
 were drowning.
Giant crabs behave much like their smaller cousins, feeding 
on both plant material like algae and fungus and animal 
matter such as fish, seabirds, and even unwary humanoids. 
The coloration of a giant crab’s hard exoskeleton varies 
widely depending on species, and over time even shifts in 
response to its diet. 
Other species of giant crab exist as well, some smaller 
but most quite a bit larger. You can adjust the stats given 
here by changing Hit Dice and size (changing Strength, 
Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to represent a

Death Roll (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, 
a crocodile can perform a death roll upon making a 
successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks 
in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its 
victim. The crocodile inflicts its bite damage and knocks 
the creature prone. If successful, the crocodile maintains 
its grapple.
hold Breath (Ex) A crocodile can hold its 
breath for a number of rounds equal 
to 4 times its Constitution score 
before it risks drowning.
Sprint (Ex) Once per minute a crocodile 
may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40 feet for 
1 round.
A crocodile is a primeval reptile that dwells in swamps or 
along the banks of rivers, a habitat that often puts it 
in violent contact with unsuspecting prey that 
come to the water’s edge to drink.
The typical crocodile is 14 feet long 
and weighs 1,400 pounds, but larger 
species exist. You can use these statistics

SPECIAL ABILITIES
flash of Insight (Su) Once per day as an immediate action, 
a cyclops can peer into an occluded visual spectrum of 
possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to select the 
exact result of one die roll before the roll is made. This 
effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops only, and 
cannot be applied to the rolls of others.
Many thousands of years ago, the solemn cyclopes ruled 
vast kingdoms, yet today their glories are long forgotten. 
What few cyclopes survive seldom aspire higher than 
protecting their lairs and seeking out their next meals. 
This latter task occupies a great deal of their focus, for 
the monstrous appetites and vacuous hunger of the 
cyclopes control the race’s destiny and may have led to 
their original downfall so long ago. 
The average cyclops stands 9 feet tall and weighs 
600 pounds. Both males and females are almost 

completely bald, with stringy patches of dark hair 
occasionally hanging down from above the ears. A bushy, 
expressive brow couples with a cyclops’s massive eye to 
make the creature’s attitude easily known.
Cyclopean history is a vanishing thing inscribed on the 
crumbling walls of vine-choked lost cities that fell long 
before even the rise of the elves, when dragons and giants 
ruled a landscape unspoiled by the petty ephemeral races 
that rule today. Because things have fallen so far, a given 
cyclops is less likely to know the near-mythic triumphs of 
lost ages than even a semi-educated human.
Ancient records, the oral traditions of other giantish 
races, and the scattered accounts of tribal natives of the 
southern jungles speak of much larger, more primal 
“great cyclopes,” imposing titans with shaggy legs and a 
massive horn above an inquisitive eye. These creatures are 
thought to have been either the leaders or the war beasts 
of the ancient race, and modern cyclopes honor them as 
elusive, destructive living gods.

A single huge eye stares from the forehead of this nine-foot-tall 
giant. Below this sole orb, an even larger mouth gapes like a cave.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Throes (Su) When a dark creeper is slain, its body combusts 
in a flash of bright white light, leaving its gear in a heap on the 
ground. All creatures within a 10-foot burst must make a DC 13 
Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Other dark creepers 
within 10 feet are automatically blinded for at least 1 round, due 
to their light blindness. The save is Constitution-based. 
Poison Use (Ex) Dark creepers are skilled in the use of poison 
and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Dark 
creepers favor a foul-smelling black paste distilled from 
certain deep-underground fungi known as black smear—
injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; 
effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.
Rag Armor (Ex) A dark creeper’s multiple layers of filthy rags 
function as leather armor when worn by one of their kind.
See in Darkness (Su) A dark creeper can see perfectly in darkness 
of any kind, including that created by deeper darkness.
Dark creepers lurk in the black places deep below 
the surface of the world, venturing forth at night or 

into neighboring societies when the urge to steal and 
cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers 
of filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small 
creatures, leading some to believe that the creature 
inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups, 
dark creepers f lee from bright light, but are quite brave 
in the dark.
Dark creepers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 
80 pounds. Their f lesh is pale and moist, and their eyes 
are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of 
sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that 
they never take off their clothing—instead piling on new 
layers when the outermost one grows too ragged.
For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers 
can cause, this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe 
led by the taller, even more sinister dark stalkers represents. 
Dark creepers treat their tall, lithe masters almost like 
gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying their 
every whim. Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as 
leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe’s heavy 
work and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the 
creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own decadent 
pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent 
imbalance in this arrangement—to a dark creeper, a life in 
the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.

Filthy, reeking black rags wrap this small humanoid from head to 
toe, leaving only its hands and pale white nose visible.

explosion. This save is Constitution-based.

See in Darkness (Su) A dark stalker can see perfectly in darkness 
of any kind, including that created by deeper darkness.
The strange and mysterious dark stalkers are the undisputed 
leaders of dark folk society. Deep underground, these creatures 
dwell in strange villages (some rumors suggest entire cities) 
built of stone and fungus in remote caverns where they are 
served and worshiped by their coarser, diminutive kin, the 
dark creepers. Dark stalkers come to the surface rarely, but 
when they do it is on a mission, and with a force of creatures 
such that it never ends well for those they seek to rob 
or torment.
Dark stalkers are tall, frail humanoids with incredibly 
pale skin. They constantly wear multiple layers of dark 
cloth and black leather armor, yet unlike their lesser 
kin, a dark stalker’s garb is always 
clean and spotless. Each dark stalker 
carries a pair of short swords—
they prefer these weapons 
to all others. Dark stalkers 
are 6 feet tall and weigh 100 
pounds.
In a fight, dark stalkers are not 
above sacrificing lesser creatures, 
including dark creepers, to win the 
day or cover their retreat if things 
go poorly. They hate well-lit areas 
and always prefer to fight under 
the cover of deeper darkness. Dark 
stalkers rarely fight to the death if 
it can be avoided, preferring to slip 
away if things begin to look grim.
The origins of the dark stalkers 
and the dark creepers are shrouded 
in mystery, made more difficult to 
decipher by the fact that the dark 
stalkers do not keep records of 
their history. Many scholars 
believe that, just as the drow 
descended from elves, so 
too must the dark folk have 
descended from humanity, their 
eerie powers and spell-like abilities 
the result of generation upon generation of 
devotion to profane and sinister magic. 
Alas, the truth of the race’s history may 
never be known.

This tall humanoid’s pale brow and black, soulless eyes are all 
that can be seen above a black scarf wrapped around its face.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
grab (Ex) A darkmantle can use its grab attack 
against a foe of any size.
A darkmantle’s tentacle-span measures just under 5 feet—
when attached to a cave roof and disguised as a stalactite, 
its length varies from 2 to 3 feet. A typical darkmantle 
weighs 40 pounds. The creatures’ heads and bodies 
are usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but 
their webbed tentacles can change color to 
match their surroundings.
The darkmantle isn’t a particularly good 
climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like 
a bat, hanging by the hooks at the ends of 
its tentacles so that its dangling body looks nearly 
indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden 
position, the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, 
at which point it drops and swoops down to attack 
its victim, slamming its body against the foe 
and attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles 
around the target. If the darkmantle misses its 
prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its 
prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously 

injured (in which case the creature f lutters back up to 
the roof to hide and hope its “prey” leaves it alone). The 
darkmantle’s inborn ability to cloak the area around it 
in magical darkness gives it an additional advantage 
over foes that rely upon light to see.
Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and 
passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend 
to possess more traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet 
they do not confine themselves to these dark caverns, and 
can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses or 
even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is 
plentiful and there’s a ceiling to cling to is a possible den 
for a darkmantle.
A darkmantle’s life cycle is swift—young grow to 
maturity in a matter of months, and most die of old 
age after only a few years. As a result, generations of 
darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the 
evolution of these creatures is similarly swift. In this 
manner, a cavern’s ecosystem can have a significant 
effect on a group of darkmantles’ appearance, abilities, 
and tactics. Aquatic caverns might develop darkmantles 
that can swim, while those beset with volcanism might 
generate darkmantles with a resistance to fire. Other 
darkmantle variants might develop much stonier 
hides, and instead of swooping down to crush prey 
might simply drop and pierce them through with their 
stalactite-like lengths. The deepest, darkest caverns are 
rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable 
of smothering multiple human-sized foes at once in 
their leathery folds.

As this creature falls from the cavern roof, it opens like a hideous 
octopus, its thin, hook-lined tentacles connected by a fleshy web.

Demon
Demons exist for one reason—to destroy. Where their 
more lawful counterparts, the devils of Hell, seek to 
twist mortal minds and values to remake and reshape 
them into ref lections of their own evil, demons seek 
only to maim, ruin, and feed. They recruit mortal life 
only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction 
of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their 
enemy—for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon’s 
depredations and f lee to his just reward in the afterlife. It 
is the prolonging of mortal pain and suffering that fuels 
a demon’s lusts and desires, for it is partially from mortal 
sin and cruelty that these monstrous fiends were born.
Demons are the most prolific and among the most 
destructive of the fiendish races, yet despite what some 
lore might preach, they were not the first forms of life to 
rise in the stinking pits of ruin and cruelty known across 
the multiverse as the Abyss. Before the first f ledgling 
deity gazed upon reality, before mortal life drew its 
breath, before even the Material Plane itself had fully 
formed, the Abyss was infested with life.
Known to many scholars as “proto-demons,” these 
wretched and deadly beings were the qlippoth. Today, 
because of the inf luence of sinful mortal souls upon the 
Abyss, mixed with unholy tamperings at the hands of the 
daemonic keepers of Abaddon and the cruel whims of fate 
and evolution, the rule of the qlippoth has receded. The 
proto-demons dwell now in the noxious and forgotten 
corners of the Abyss, and the far more fecund and prolific 
demons rule now in their stead. With each evil mortal 
soul that finds its way into the Abyss, the ranks of the 
demonic hordes—a single soul can fuel the manifestation 
of dozens or even hundreds of demons, with the exact 
nature of the sins carried by the soul guiding the shapes 
and roles of the newly formed fiends.
The Abyss is a vast (some say infinite) realm, far larger 
than any other plane save possibly the primal chaos of the 
Maelstrom itself. As befits such a vast and varied realm, 
the demonic host is likewise diverse. Some carry in their 
frames humanoid shapes, while others are twisted beasts. 
Some f lop on land while others f lap in air or sea. Some 
are schemers and manipulators of emotion and politics, 
others are destructive engines of ruin. Yet all demons work 
to the same goal—pain and suffering for mortal life in all 
its forms.
Yet despite this, mortals have sought demonic aid since 
the start. Be it an instinctual draw to self-destruction or a 
misguided lust for power, conjurers to this day continue to 
draw forth demons with forbidden magic. Some conjure 
demons for lore, while others call upon them to serve 
as assassins or guards. Demons view such summoners 
with a mix of hatred and thanks, for most demons lack 

the ability to come to the Material Plane to wreak havoc 
on their own. They depend on the mad to call them up 
from the Abyss, and while they gnash their fangs and 
rail against the commands and strictures enforced, most 
demons find ways to twist their summoners’ demands so 
that even the most tightly controlled demonic slave leaves 
a trace of ruin and despair in its wake. More often than 
not, a foolish spellcaster makes a fatal mistake in the 
conjuring and pays for it with blood, unwittingly releasing 
a terrible blight upon the world as his conjuration breaks 
free of his control.
The truly mad call upon demons to offer themselves, 
both body and soul, in the misguided belief that alliance 
with the demonic can buy salvation and protection when 
the demonic apocalypse finally comes to call. Tales of 
desperate kings who sought to engage demons to serve as 
generals for their armies or of lunatics who seek demonic 
sires to gift them with horrific children are common 
enough, yet worst are those mortals who worship the most 
powerful demons as gods, and who pledge their lives in 
support of that which would bring destruction to all.

Demon Lords
Demon lords are the most powerful of their kind—and as 
with the demonic horde itself, they are countless and varied. 
Although mighty, and in some cases gods themselves, no 
demon lord can claim rule of the Abyss as a whole—the best 
one can attain is rulership over a handful of Abyssal realms, 
and most can barely maintain sway over even one layer of the 
Abyss. Another category of unique demons exists between 
the mighty balor race and the demon lords—these are 
nascent demon lords, powerful entities that, in time, might 
achieve enough power that the Abyss takes note and elevates 
them to the status of actual demon lords.
The following list of demon lords is by no means complete, 
but it does enumerate many whose influence can be felt 
across countless worlds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Protective Slime (Su) A layer of acidic slime 
coats a babau’s skin. Any creature that strikes 
a babau with a natural attack or unarmed strike 
takes 1d8 points of acid damage from this slime if it fails a DC 
18 Reflex save. A creature that strikes a babau with a melee 
weapon must make a DC 18 Reflex save or the weapon takes 
1d8 points of acid damage; if this damage penetrates the 
weapon’s hardness, the weapon gains the broken 
condition. Ammunition that strikes a babau is 
automatically destroyed after it inflicts its damage.

This emaciated figure looks like a horned human skeleton 
smothered within a bone-tight hide of slimy leather.

DDeemmoonn––DDeemmoon, Babau

n, Babau

The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—
certainly not traits unusual in the demons, yet the babau’s 
penchant for stealth and surprise sets it apart from its 
generally less-subtle kin. With no need to eat (although 
most babaus relish the f lavor of mortal meat on their 
thin, raspy tongues), a babau can wait in ambush for years 
or decades—their inhuman patience in anticipating a 
well-conceived murder also setting them apart from the 
other denizens of the Abyss. Babaus obsess over the act 
of killing and take great pride in their grisly art, often 
leaving behind some form of grim marker or obscure 
signature, whether it be a distinctive modus operandi, an 
unnerving token, or other profane evidence. 
A babau typically carries a longspear or other weapon 
with which it can strike at foes beyond its normal reach, 
but given the opportunity, a babau prefers to fight 
with its teeth or claws. The foul, caustic sludge that 
constantly seeps from their f lesh prevents them from 
wearing armor unless it is specially treated or resistant 
to acid.
A babau is 6 feet tall but weighs only 140 pounds. They 
form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who, in life, 
took pleasure in more personal and intimate murders. 
Loosed upon the Material Plane, a babau often finds itself 
in the same role, haunting the shadowy corners of 
the world as remorseless assassins.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Death Throes (Su) When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding 
flash of fire that deals 100 points of damage (half fire, half 
unholy damage) to anything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 33 
halves). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Entangle (Ex) If a balor strikes a Medium or smaller foe with 
its whip, the balor can immediately attempt a grapple 
check without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the 
balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an adjacent 
square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the 
balor does not.
flaming Body (Su) A balor’s body is covered in dancing flames. 
Anyone striking a balor with a natural weapon or unarmed 
strike takes 1d6 points of fire damage. A creature that 
grapples a balor or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of 
fire damage each round the grapple persists.
Vorpal Strike (Su) Any slashing weapon a balor wields 
(including its standard longsword and whip) gains the 
vorpal weapon quality. Weapons retain this quality  
for one hour after the balor releases the weapon, but 
after this the weapon reverts to its standard magical 
qualities, if any.
Whip Mastery (Ex) A balor treats a whip as a light weapon for 
the purposes of two-weapon fighting, and can inflict lethal 
damage on a foe regardless of the foe’s armor.
When folk whisper frightened tales of the demonic, what 
most envision is a towering figure of fire and f lesh, a 
horned nightmare armed with f laming whip and sword 
f lying through the night in search of its latest victim. The 
demon these folk fear is the balor, and that fear is justly 
placed, for few demons can match the mighty balor in 
strength or brutality.
On the Abyss, most balors serve demon lords as generals 
or captains (those balors who don’t are even more potent, 
and are known as balor lords—see below). A balor typically 
commands vast legions of demons, and while it often lets 
these slavering and eager minions fight its battles, the balor 
is far from a coward. If presented with an opportunity to join 
a fight, few balors choose to resist.
In combat, a balor relies upon its spell-like abilities 
to fight foes wise enough to avoid melee range, favoring 
destructive powers like fire storm or implosion and saving 
dominate monster for use against the rare foe it would 
prefer to capture alive. A balor usually uses telekinesis to 
disarm ranged weapons or pull foes into melee—with the 
use of a quickened telekinesis, a balor can use the latter 
tactic and still inf lict a full-round attack on a hapless foe. 
A balor reduced to fewer than 50 hit points almost always 
seeks to f lee via teleportation, but if that and f light prove 
impossible it seeks to position itself such that, if it is 
slain, its death throes are as devastating as possible to 
the enemy host.

This winged fiend’s horned head and fanged visage present the 
perfection of the demonic form, fire spurting from its f lesh.

DDeemmoon, Balor

n, Balor

A balor stands 14 feet in height and weighs 4,500 pounds. 
Only the cruelest mortal souls can fuel the creation of a 
balor—unlike in the cases of most other demons, it often 
takes multiple souls of powerful villains to trigger the 
birthing of a new balor.
Balor Lords
Even more terrible than the typical balor are those who 
do not call a demon lord their master, but instead are 
masters themselves. A balor lord typically rules over a 
region no larger than half the size of the realm in which 
it resides (as only full demon lords can command the 
rule of an entire Abyssal realm), and even though most 
balor lords rule much smaller regions (generally areas 
comparable in size to a single continent), their power is 
vast indeed.
A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster (a 
range shared with the various unique nascent demon 
lords, with the range of CR 26 and above being the domain 
of the demon lords themselves), and as such serves quite 
well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The 
majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, 
fighter, or ranger (although ranger balor lords never 
form bonds with animals), but some instead have levels 
of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords are 

unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, 
not the other way around, although rumors persist of 
powerful balor clerics that directly serve demon lords or 
even evil gods.
In addition to any benefits a balor lord might gain 
from its class levels, all balor lords possess one additional 
unique ability over and above those granted by its race and 
class. Listed here are three sample balor lord abilities, but 
these samples are by no means the entirety of the strange 
powers a balor lord might wield.
Lifedrinker (Su) Whenever the balor lord slays a living 
foe, it receives the benefits of a heal spell (CL 20th). This 
ability can activate up to once per round.
Master of Magic (Su) The balor lord has additional 
spell-like abilities (20 spell levels’ worth of 1st–4th level 
spells usable at will and 20 spell levels’ worth of 5th–8th 
level spells usable 3 times a day).
Soul Swallow (Su) As a standard action, the balor lord 
can inhale the soul of a living creature within 30 feet. The 
target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 balor lord’s 
racial HD + the balor lord’s Charisma modifier) or die. 
The body of a humanoid creature killed in this manner 
immediately transforms into a demon under the balor 
lord’s command (a babau, succubus, or shadow demon, 
according to the balor lord’s whim).

Even the lowest demons of the Abyss are 
dangerous and filled with a driving need to spread ruin 
and dismay. The lowly dretch is as hideous and foul as 
it is cruel, even if it lacks the strength and power to 
realize its need to brutalize others in its native realm. 
The lot of the dretch’s existence is to serve more 
powerful demons as victims, and only the lucky few 
survive long enough to evolve.
The dretch is a favorite target for dabblers in Abyssal 
summonings to call forth. Relatively weak and easy to 
bully, dretches can often be pressured into long periods 
of servitude with only vague promises of the opportunity 
to vent their frustrations and anger on softer foes. Yet 
the prospective dretch-summoner would do 
well to remember that these demons are as 
craven and untrustworthy as they come. A 
dretch faced with a more powerful foe is 
only too eager to trade what it knows for its 
pitiful excuse for a life.

Unlike most demons, a dretch’s slovenly personality 
and disdain for prolonged physical labor rarely result 
in success. Advanced dretches are rare, but those who do 
find it within themselves to be more than they were at 
creation often become the pauper-kings of the Abyss, 
cruel and bitter in their rule over vermin, broken souls, 
mindless undead, and other dretches. Their empires 
are confined to abandoned stretches of sewers under 
backwater cities, unstable reaches of swampland avoided 
by more sensible minds, and other undesirable corners of 
the Abyss that even demons find uncomfortable or foul. 
Yet to the dretch lords, these realms are their empires, 
and they defend them with a pitiful tenacity.
A dretch stands 4 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. 
Dretches typically form from the souls of slothful, evil 
mortals—yet it only takes a small fragment of a soul 
to trigger such a hideous birth. A single soul can often 
trigger the manifestation of a small army of dretches, and 
the sight of a horde of fresh-birthed dretches pulling free 
from the heaving protomatter of the Abyss is a nauseating 
and terrifying one indeed.

This creature’s bloated frame shudders with each heaving step, 
yet despite its shape, the thing moves with surprising quickness.

Whereas the succubus is a demon that works her wiles 
by exploiting the physical lusts and needs of her prey, 
the glabrezu is a tempter of a different sort. Ferocious 
and bestial in form, the glabrezu is in fact a master of 
trickery and lies. With its ability to cloak its true form in 
pleasant illusions, the glabrezu uses its magic to grant 

Four arms grace the torso of this towering monstrosity. The 
monster’s eyes shine with a mix of intelligence and cruelty.

wishes to mortal humanoids as a method of rewarding 
those who succumb to its guile and deceit. A wish granted 
by a glabrezu always fulfills the wisher’s need in the most 
destructive way possible—although such methods might 
not be immediately apparent. A struggling weaponsmith 
might wish for fame and skill at his craft, only to find 
that his best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who 
uses the weapons to further his destructive desires. A 
lonely man who wishes for a companion might have his 
wish granted in the form of a lost love returned to “life” 
as a vampire, and so on—the glabrezu is nothing if not 
creative in addressing a mortal’s desires.
A glabrezu stands 18 feet tall and weighs just over 6,000 
pounds. These treacherous demons form from the souls 
of the treasonous, the false, and the subversive—souls of 
mortals who, in life, bore false witness or used treachery 
and deceit to ruin the lives of others.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
nausea (Ex) The noxious vapors and foul fluids that 
constantly weep and seethe from a hezrou’s body 
are particularly heinous to those the creature 
grapples. Each round a creature is grappled by 
a hezrou, the grappled foe must make a DC 24 
Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated. A 
creature nauseated in this manner remains nauseated 
until he succeeds on a DC 24 Fortitude save, or until a 
minute has passed during which he is not grappled by 
the hezrou, whichever condition comes first. The save 
DC is Constitution-based.

The hezrou dwells in the vast Abyssal swamps, mires, and 
waterways, equally at home on land and in the water. The 
presence of a hezrou has an obvious effect on the nearby 
f lora and water, causing plant life to twist and knurl and 
infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste—
signs much easier to spot on the Material Plane than the 
Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile 
transformations and hideous deformities. Often, entire 
backwater communities of deformed mutants owe their 
twisted countenances not as much to incest and poor 
breeding as they do to a hezrou’s proximity.
Although quite intelligent, a hezrou can fairly be said to 
waste its intellect. They prefer the simple pleasures—slumber, 
the thrill of torture, the bliss of feasting on a living meal, or the 
joy of feeling something beautiful breaking and crumbling in 
a clenched fist. They do not often seek to build empires or lead 
cults—although few hezrous would turn away prospective 
minions who came to serve the demon on their own.
These monstrous and bestial creatures form from the 
souls of evil mortals who poisoned themselves, their kin, 
or their surroundings, such as drug addicts, assassins, and 
alchemists who cared not how their experiments polluted 
the environment.

This fiend’s armored f lesh is scaly and moist. Its large, toothy 
mouth gapes below a pair of hungry, reptilian eyes.

Infuse Weapon (Su) Any weapon a marilith wields gains a +1 
enhancement bonus to attack and damage, and strikes as 
if it were a chaotic and evil cold iron weapon (in addition to 
retaining the qualities of its actual composition).
Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) A marilith never takes penalties to 
her attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons.
The leaders of Abyssal hordes and queens of Abyssal 
nations, the dreaded mariliths serve demon lords as 
governesses, advisors, and even lovers, yet their brilliance 
as tacticians makes them most sought after as generals and 
commanders of armies. The most powerful mariliths serve 
no one, and instead command ravenous fiendish legions.
A marilith is 6 to 9 feet tall and measures 20 feet from 
head to tail tip. It weighs 4,000 pounds. Only the most 
arrogant and proud evil souls, typically those of cruel 
kings, sadistic generals, and exceptionally violent warlords, 
can trigger the manifestation of a marilith.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Consume Life (Su) When a nabasu creates a ghoul 
with its gaze attack, it gains a growth point. It 
gains a bonus equal to its growth point total 
on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, caster 
level checks, and skill checks. Its maximum hit 
points increase by 10 for each growth point, and 
its caster level for spell-like abilities increases by 
1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor 
bonus, SR,  and CR increase by 1. Every time it 
gains a growth point it makes a DC 30 caster level 
check—success indicates it matures (gaining both 
the advanced and the giant simple templates) and plane 
shifts to the Abyss in a burst of smoke. A nabasu can have a 

maximum of 20 growth points—it automatically matures if it 
has not done so already when it reaches 20 growth points.
Death-Stealing gaze (Su) As a free action once per day per 
growth point (minimum of 1/day), a nabasu can activate its 
death-stealing gaze for a full round. All living creatures within 
30 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or gain a 
negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner immediately 
transforms into a ghoul under the nabasu’s control. A nabasu’s 
gaze can only create one ghoul per round—if multiple humans 
perish from the gaze in a round, the nabasu picks which 
human becomes a ghoul. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material Plane from 
the Abyss, where they feed on innocent souls to mature. 
Only when finally sated can a nabasu return to the Abyss. 
Rumor holds that even then the nabasu’s lifecycle does 
not change, and that further developments await them as 
they continue to grow. These vile demons form from the 
souls of evil gluttons, particularly from cannibals, blood-
drinkers, and those who prefer the tang of undead f lesh.

This lanky fiend’s mouth is filled with sharp fangs, while great 
bat-like wings stretch from its scaly hide.

of madness hound it. The save DC is Charisma-based. 
Few demons understand the inner workings of the Abyss 
like the nalfeshnee, and it is not unusual to see a nalfeshnee 
seeming to serve the Abyss itself rather than a demon 
lord. Some claim stewardship over the f leshy realms that 
birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular 
significance deep in the plane’s secret reaches. Often, a 
nalfeshnee’s realm in the Abyss surpasses the strength 
and size of the largest of mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees 
display a singular gift for managing and ordering the 
chaos of the Abyss. Mortal summoners often seek them 
out for their unparalleled yet mad intellects, ever taking 
care to comb through bargains with such demons for 
hidden and unwanted consequences, for there is little a 
nalfeshnee will agree to do that does not, in some sinister 
way, advance the needs and desires of the Abyss.
Nalfeshnees stand 20 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds. 
They form from the souls of greedy or avaricious evil 
mortals, particularly those who ruled over empires of 
slavery, theft, banditry, and more violent vices.

The quasit is perhaps the least powerful demon, yet it is not 
the least respected—even quasits hold themselves above the 
dretch horde, and true to their natures, dretches lack the 
courage or drive to prove the quaits wrong. A quasit’s first 
role in life is that of a familiar to a spellcasting master, but 
those quasits who escape from this humiliating servitude 
become free-willed and much more dangerous.
A typical quasit stands a foot and a half tall, and weighs 
only 8 pounds. Alone among the demonic horde, quasits 
do not form from the dead souls of evil mortals. Instead, 
they form from living souls—when a spellcaster seeks out 
a quasit to serve him as a familiar, his 
soul brushes against the Abyss and 
it reacts, carving from itself a quasit 
linked to that spellcaster’s soul and 
forming a powerful bond between the two. 
Newly created quasits are birthed directly 
into the Material Plane, where they become 
familiars, and while bonded to their 
masters’ wills, all quasits hate and loathe 
their lieges, as they can feel the pulse of 
their lords’ souls and know that they 
could have been more. A quasit serves, 
yet it watches and waits for mistakes 
that might cost its master’s life, 
or even better, an error that 
might let the quasit turn 
against its master.
When a quasit’s master 
dies, the quasit can attempt 
to follow the master’s soul 
into the Great Beyond by 
making a DC 15 Will save. 
This functions as plane 
shift, but affects only the 
quasit and transports 
it into the Abyss and 
places its master’s soul in the 
quasit’s possession as a writhing 
larvae rather than using the evil 
master’s soul to create new demonic 
life. In this manner, a quasit can use 
its newly captured soul to bargain 
with more powerful denizens of the 
lower planes, and perhaps secure a 
vile transformative “promotion” 
to a more powerful form of life in 
the process.
Rarely, a quasit elects to ignore 
its master’s death and instead 
remains on the Material Plane to 
seek other ways to entertain itself—usually settling in an 
urban area where there are plenty of folk to torment.

Ram horns curl back from the twisted head of this tiny winged 
demon, and its body is thin and wiry.

Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) A shadow demon is

Only this shadowy bat-winged demon’s teeth and claws have any

and flees from it. A shadow demon caught in such light cannot 
attack and can take only a single move or attack action. A 
shadow demon that is possessing a creature using magic jar 
is not harmed by sunlight, but if it is struck by a sunbeam or 
sunray spell while possessing a creature, the shadow demon is 
driven out of its host automatically.
Tales of demonic possession are common, used often by 
the ignorant to explain strange or violent behavior. While 
the majority of such cases are merely manifestations 
of madness or derangement, those that are legitimate 
possessions are often the work of shadow demons.
Unlike many demons, shadow demons are incorporeal. 
When a particularly envious and evil mortal soul is 
pulled into the Abyss, it is transformed, split apart, and 
combined with other souls until what emerges is little 
more than jealous malevolence without the impediment 
of a physical body.

Energy Drain (Su) A succubus drains energy from a mortal 
she lures into an act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling 
victim must be grappled before the succubus can use this 
ability. The succubus’s kiss bestows one negative level. 
The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the 
victim to accept another act of passion from the succubus. 
The victim must succeed on a DC 22 Will save to negate the 
suggestion. The DC is 22 for the Fortitude save to remove a 
negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.

Profane gift (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a 
succubus may grant a profane gift to a willing humanoid 
creature by touching it for 1 full round. The target gains a 
+2 profane bonus to an ability score of his choice. A single 
creature may have no more than one profane gift from a 
succubus at a time. As long as the profane gift persists, the 
succubus can communicate telepathically with the target 
across any distance (and may use her suggestion spell-like 
ability through it). A profane gift is removed by dispel evil or 
dispel chaos. The succubus can remove it as well as a free 
action (causing 2d6 Charisma drain to the victim, no save).
Among the demon hordes, a succubus can often rise to 
incredible heights of power through her manipulations 
and sensual charms, and many a demonic war has raged 
due to the subtle machinations of such creatures. A 
succubus is formed from the souls of particularly lustful 
and rapacious evil mortals.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Dance of Ruin (Su) A vrock can dance and chant 
as a full-round action—at the end of 3 rounds, 
a crackling wave of energy explodes from the 
vrock, dealing 5d6 points of electricity damage 
to all creatures within 100 feet. A DC 17 Reflex save 
halves this damage. For each additional vrock that joins in 
the dance, the damage increases by 5d6 and the DC to avoid 
the effect increases by +1, to a maximum of 20d6 when four 
or more vrocks are dancing (the DC continues to increase 
with additional vrocks, but the damage does not). The dance 
immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the 
participating vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented 
from dancing. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A cloud of spores and a trail of feathers surrounds this twisted 
cross between a man and a gigantic vulture.

Spores (Ex) A vrock can release a cloud of spores from its body 
once every 3 rounds as a free action. Adjacent creatures take 
1d8 points of damage from the spores, plus 1d4 points of 
damage per round for 10 rounds as the spores grow into 
thick green vines. Although ugly, the vines are harmless and 
wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The 
spores can be destroyed by casting bless on the affected 
creatures or by sprinkling them with holy water. This 
attack can also be halted by effects that remove or provide 
immunity to disease.
Stunning Screech (Su) Once per hour, a vrock can emit a shrill 
screech. All creatures except demons within a 30-foot-
radius spread must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or 
be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Profane champions of the Abyss, vrocks embody all the 
rage, hatred, and violence of that despicable realm. As 
ravenous and grotesquely opportunistic as the scavengers 
they resemble, vrocks delight in bloodshed, relishing 
the sounds and sensations of ripping the still-pulsing 
entrails from a living husk. 
A typical vrock stands 8 
feet tall and weighs 400 
pounds. Vrocks generally 
form from the evil souls 
of hateful and wrathful 
mortals, particularly  those 
who were career criminals, 
mercenaries, or assassins.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Madness (Ex) Derros use their 
Charisma modifier on Will 
saves instead of their Wisdom 

modifier, and are immune to insanity and confusion 
effects. Only a miracle or wish can remove a derro’s 
madness. If this occurs, the derro gains 6 points of 
Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.
Poison Use (Ex) Derros are not at risk of poisoning themselves 
when handling poison. They use Medium spider venom 
to poison their crossbow bolts, and generally carry 10 pre-
poisoned bolts at all times.
Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) A derro takes 1 point of Con 
damage after every hour it is exposed to sunlight.
Though derros dwell deep under most of the surface 
world’s cities, very few know of the sadistic creatures’ 
existence. Descended from mysterious fey that once dwelt 
deep underground, the derros lust for the comforts of the 
surface, yet the light of the sun causes them to blister, 
burn, and die. Derros often abduct surface dwellers to 
perform hideous experiments on them in their never-
ending quest to divine what protects those who dwell 
above from the burning death, yet the 
intrinsic madness that plagues all derros 
dooms these experiments to failure 
every time. In the end, traumatized 
victims are returned to their homes, 
memories not quite 
completely wiped 
of their ordeal, to 
live the rest of 
their lives in vague 
fear of a nightmare 
they can’t quite recall.
A typical derro fights 
with a short sword or a 
repeating light crossbow 
with plenty of poison bolts. 
Some derros also carry an 
aklys—a hooked throwing 
club attached to a 20-foot- 
long cord. This cord limits 
the club’s range, but allows the 
derro to retrieve it as a move-
equivalent action after it has 
been thrown.
Derro leaders are typically 
sorcerers of at least 3rd level, 
although they also make excellent 
rogues. Many derros wield strange 
and unusual weapons like hooked 
polearms, eerie whistling aklyses, long hollow spears 
that can be filled with toxins, or crystalline 
throwing wedges that shatter on impact to create 
horrific bleeding wounds.
A derro stands 3 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds.

This pale blue humanoid has bulging white eyes, wild hair, four-
fingered hands, and a large hooked club.

DDeerrrroo––DDeevviill

Devil
Masters of corruption and despoilers of purity, devils seek 
to destroy all things good and drag mortal souls back with 
them to the depths of Hell. Possessed of deadly infernal 
powers and unified under the banner of Asmodeus, the 
Prince of Darkness, and his eight archdevil tyrants, the 
legions of Hell guard and torment the foulest spirits of the 
multiverse, but ever eye the worlds of the Material Plane in 
search of new conquests.
As the most numerous fiendish occupants of Hell, the 
various forms of devils are well catalogued by diabolists. 
Most are known by two names: an evocative title given to 
the fiends by commoners and folklore, and an obscure, 
ancient designation spoken by the servants of Hell and 
those who would seek to deal with the damned.
Born from the foulest of mortal souls—their 
personalities and memories long since scoured by 
millennia of torment—would-be devils rise from the 
masses of suffering souls as lemures, revolting beings 
of mindless evil potentiality. Only through continued 
centuries of torture or by the edicts of more powerful 
devils do these least of devilkind rise to become 
deadlier fiends, graduating through a pain-wracked 
metamorphosis dictated by their masters or the infernal 
whims of Hell’s semi-sentient layers. While fiendish lords 
wield transformation into greater or lesser forms as both 
prize and punishment, some devils spontaneously rise 
from particularly evil souls long trapped upon an infernal 
layer. Thus, although the various diabolical breeds possess 
recognizable abilities and hold generalized rankings in 
the great infernal hierarchy, a devil’s type alone does not 
always correspond to a specific tenure of torment or place 
in the infernal chain of command. Asmodeus’s legions 
hold respect for aptitude and experience, and a particularly 
skilled lesser devil might come to oversee newly formed 
members of a fundamentally more powerful form.
Devils fill the nine layers of Hell, though certain 
fiends are more common on specific layers than others, 
their specialized duties or fealty to individual archdevils 
drawing them to one torturous domain more than 
others. Although the various types of devils tend to 
specialize in unique forms of depravity or temptation, 
the hierarchies of Hell are not without f lexibility for 
uncommon individual talents. Thus, particularly 
watchful hamatulas might join the ranks of Phlegethon’s 
bone devil inquisitors, while veteran barbazus might 
serve among the pit fiends of Nessus. 
Beyond the pits of Hell, devils often travel to the 
Material Plane at the summons of evil spellcasters. Quick 
to bargain and willing to serve mortals to assure their 
damnation, devils ever obey the letter of their agreements, 
but serve the whims of Hell foremost. Thus, even the least 

of devilkind might come to the Material Plane intent on 
further corrupting souls, cleverly escaping the bonds of 
their contracts to indulge their own plots, or to further 
the unspeakable goals of the archdevils of Hell.
The Ranks of Devilkind
Diabolists speak often of the rankings of Hell, the 
distinctions made between devils that distinguish the 
foot soldiers from the commanders of Hell’s armies. 
While such divisions mean little to most mortals—a devil 
being a deadly foe in any incarnation—the hierarchies 
and nuances of Hell’s society carry distinctions vital to 
the survival of any who would commune with devils. What 
distinguishes a breed of devils above or below others is 
more than a matter of brawn, with several cunning types of 
fiend holding priority over their fundamentally stronger 
brethren. While a devil’s station does not mean it can 
instantly command every other devil of inferior standing, 
it does imply which fiends might serve their brethren or 
hold inf luence over others.
While the ruler of Hell is Asmodeus, his concerns are 
much more sweeping and broad—he leaves most of the 
lesser duties of Hell to his eight archdevils and their 
legions of infernal dukes. Below these are the devil races 
themselves, from the lordly and malevolent pit fiends all 
the way down to the lowly, malformed lemure.
The Infernal Hierarchy
Listed here, from the absolute weakest devils to the lords 
of Hell, is the most basic hierarchy of the infernal realm’s 
best-known denizens.
Least Devils: imps, lemures
Lesser Devils: bearded devils (barbazus), erinyes, 
barbed devils (hamatulas), bone devils (osyluths)
Greater Devils: horned devils (cornugons), ice devils 
(gelugons), pit fiends
Lords of Hell: Dukes of Hell, archdevils, Asmodeus

Some Known Devils
Amid the pits of Hell plot countless diabolical lords. Here 
is a list of just a few of the infernal personalities known to 
diabolists.
 Astaroth, Prince of Accusers
 Baalzebul, Lord of the Flies

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Barbed Defense (Su) A creature that strikes a 
  hamatula with a melee weapon, an unarmed 
strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d8+6 points 
of piercing damage from the devil’s barbs. Melee weapons 
with reach do not endanger a user in this way.
fear (Su) A barbed devil’s fear attack affects any creature 
it damages with its claws. A DC 20 Will save resists this 
effect, otherwise the victim becomes frightened for 1d4 
rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is 
Charisma-based.

From the tip of its lashing tail to the serrated features of its fang-
filled visage, this fiery-eyed sentinel bristles with barbs.

Impale (Ex) A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing 
damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful 
grapple check.
Sentinels of the vaults of Hell, jailers of the darkest 
souls, and living weapons of the infernal forges, barbed 
devils—known as hamatulas to diabolists—enforce the 
strictures of the damned and safeguard the nefarious 
works of greater devils. A hamatula enjoys the feel of 
warm blood on its spines, and prefers to leap into melee 
when presented with an opportunity for battle.
Hamatulas are collectors and organizers, and are 
favorite allies of greedy summoners as they often bring 
with them tempting treasures from Hell’s vaults or know 
the paths to deadly riches. Left to their own devices, the 
lairs of these devils often bear the pierced trophies of 
their past victims, hung like perverse bug collections on 
bloodied walls. Most barbed devils stand upward of 7 feet 
tall and weigh 300 pounds, though their leanly muscled 
bodies appear much larger due to the constantly growing 
and adjusting spines that protrude from their razor-
sharp bodies.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Beard (Ex) If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both 
claw attacks, it also lashes at the same target with its spiky, 
filthy beard. The victim takes 1d8+2 points of damage and 
must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or contract devil 
chills. The save DC is Constitution-based. 
Devil Chills: Disease—injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 
1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 3 
consecutive saves.
Infernal Wound (Su) The damage a bearded devil deals with 
its glaive inflicts persistent wounds that cause 2 points of 
bleed damage. Bleed caused from an infernal wound is 
particularly difficult to stanch—a DC 17 Heal check stops 
the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering 
from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 16 caster 

This seething devil deftly wields a vicious, saw-toothed glaive, 
while below its toothy maw writhes a hideous, twitching beard.

DDeevviill,, BBaarrbbeedd––DDeevviill,, BBeeaarrddeedd

level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates 
the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects on 
the victim. The infernal wounds caused by a bearded devil 
are a supernatural ability of the devil, not of the weapon.
Elite warriors in Hell’s legions, bearded devils—or 
barbazus—fight savagely in the name of their infernal 
lords and command mindless hordes of the damned into 
battle. They collect and train with their infernally forged 
glaives among the vaults of Hell’s third layer, Erebus, but 
inevitably return to the first layer, Avernus, to serve at the 
side of the dread lord Barbatos.
Barbazus are fond of making charge attacks with 
their glaives, and try to maintain a 10-foot gap between 
themselves and their foes so they can use their signature 
polearms to great effect. Against a foe that has greater 
reach (or one able to otherwise avoid the devil’s favored 
tactic), they drop their glaives and resort to their claws 
and hideous beards.
At attention, bearded devils stand over 6 feet tall 
(though their squatting battle stances often make them 
appear shorter) and weigh upward of 200 pounds.

The interrogators and inquisitors of devilkind, 
bone devils delight in torturing those weaker than 
themselves—mortals, souls, and other devils 
alike. Born of ancient heresies mired amid the 
Styx-fed swamps of Stygia, Hell’s fifth layer, 
bone devils—also known as osyluths—enforce 
infernal order and the will of the archdevils. 

Powerful fiends favor these terrifying sadists for their 
unwavering devotion to Hell’s laws and the commands of 
their masters, as osyluths eagerly report the disobedience 
of other devils—regardless of standing—and take to the 
craft of torture like morbid artists. Diabolists risk much 
to bargain with them, as bone devils glean many infernal 
secrets amid their nightmarish calcified torture hives. 
These devils especially delight in journeying to the mortal 
plane, as their cruel talents and service to evil spellcasters 
often mean gaining much valuable information, which they 
might hold in their perfect memories for centuries before 
reporting back to their diabolical masters.
In battle, an osyluth uses quickened invisibility after 
each attack to confuse foes. Many osyluths carry twisted 
and eerie bone weapons, but these tools are more for 
torture and intimidation than actual combat. 
Osyluths tower over lesser devils at 9 feet tall—though 
their tails and fearsome but useless 
wings make them appear much 
larger—and weigh upward 
of 400 pounds.

Merging the most horrifying features of carrion-fed insect and 
withered cadaver, this bony devil moves in unsettling lurches.

Some calamity has befallen this angelic warrior. Wings stained

Bone–Devil, Erinyes

Entangle (Su) Each erinyes carries a 50-foot-long rope that 
entangles opponents of any size as an animate rope spell 
(CL 16th, DC 20). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet 
with no range penalty. An erinyes’s rope functions only 
for the erinyes who made it and no other. The save DC is 
Dexterity-based.
Known by many names—the Fallen, the Ash Wings, and 
the Furies—the devils called erinyes mock the form of 
the angelic hosts in their exaction of vengeance and 
bloody justice. Executioners, not judges, 
erinyes alight upon the bladed eaves of 
Dis, Hell’s cosmopolitan second layer, 
ever attentive for chances to soar into 
battle, whether in defense of Hell, on 
the whims of diabolical masters, or at 
the impassioned summons of jilted 
mortal summoners. All erinyes 
weave deadly living ropes from 
their own hair, which they use in 
battle to lift their foes into the air, 
mocking and condemning their 
victims for their transgressions 
before dropping them from 
great heights. 
Erinyes appear as darkly 
beautiful angels, augmenting 
their sensuality with deliberate 
bruises and scars. Yet despite 
their beauty, erinyes are not 
seducers—they lack the subtlety 
and patience required for such 
fine emotional manipulations, 
and instead vastly prefer to solve 
their problems with swift and 
excruciating violence. Often, an 
erinyes will stay her hand before 
attempting to slay a foe simply 
so she can draw out the victim’s 
suffering. Death is usually the 
only way to escape an erinyes’s 
not-so-tender attentions, 
and the most powerful of 
these devils excel at keeping 
their enemies alive but helpless so as to extend 
their torment—many going as far as to keep their 
victims alive with magic. Rumors hold that the most 
powerful erinyes torturers have skills that allow their 
torment to continue even after their subject has died 
from their attentions.
Most erinyes stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh 
approximately 140 pounds, even with their black- 
feathered wings that stretch over 10 feet wide. 75

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Infernal Wound (Su) The damage a horned devil deals with 
its tail causes persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of 
bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to 
staunch—a DC 26 Heal check stops the damage, and any 
attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal 
wound must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check 
or the spell does not function. Success indicates the 
healing works normally and stops all bleed effects.

Stun (Su) Whenever a horned devil hits with a spiked chain 
attack, the opponent must succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude 
save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This ability is a function 
of the horned devil, not of the spiked chain. The save DC is 
Strength-based.
Among the deadliest of the archdevils’ warriors and able 
commanders of lesser fiends, horned devils spread the 
rule of Hell wherever they tread. These greater devils are 
trained, forged, and reforged to be among the most lethal, 
merciless, and obedient warriors in the multiverse. While 
rank-and-file horned devils are called cornugons, the 
greatest of their kind are known as malebranche.
A typical horned devil rises to a hulking 9 feet tall, 
bears 14-foot-wide wings, and weighs 700 pounds.

Bristling with terrible spines and a crown of deadly horns, this 
leering winged terror wields a whirling barbed chain.

Slow (Su) A hit from an ice devil’s tail or spear induces 
numbing cold. The opponent must succeed on a DC 23

The save DC is Constitution-based.
Strategists and masterminds of Hell’s armies, the 
insectile ice devils possess some of the most cruelly 
ingenious minds in Asmodeus’s legions. It is said that 

A pair of frozen, multifaceted eyes coldly judge all before this 
towering, insectile monstrosity.

each ice devil—known as gelugons among the ranks 
of devilkind—bears within its chest a stolen, frozen 
mortal heart, which allows it to make decisions free of all 
emotion. Born on the icy layer of Cocytus, Hell’s seventh 
layer, most ice devils migrate to Caina, the eighth layer, 
where they plot world-damning machinations from 
courts of freezing steel. Although they are perhaps the 
most alien and monstrous in appearance of all devils, few 
breeds are accorded greater respect. 
In combat, a gelugon prefers to let its minions engage 
foes in melee so that it can hang back and appraise the foe’s 
tactics, strengths, and weaknesses. The ice devil supports 
its minions with its spell-like abilities, always taking care 
to avoid impacting its minions in the area of effect of its 
spells—this not from any sense of camaraderie, only a 
cold and logical truth that its allies can survive longer in 
a fight if they are not exposed to friendly fire.
Gelugons stand at 12 feet tall, and weigh approximately 
700 pounds.

Born directly from the pits of Hell, imps are 
among the least of the true devils; these vicious, 
manipulative fiends, however, hold an important 
role in the corruption of mortal souls. Unfettered from 
the ranks and duties of diabolical armies, imps delight in 
any opportunity to travel to the Material Plane and subtly 
tempt mortals toward acts of ever-greater depravity. 
Willingly serving spellcasters as familiars, imps play 

the role of dutiful servants, often granting their masters 
cunning advice and infernal insights. In truth, though, 
an imp works to deliver souls to Hell, assuring that its 
master’s soul—and as many collateral souls as possible—
faces damnation upon death.
Imps vary widely in appearance, ranging through a 
spectrum of bestial traits and grotesque body shapes, 
though most take the forms of red-skinned, winged 
humanoids with bulbous features. Such a typical imp 
stands a mere 2 feet tall, has a 3-foot wingspan, and 
weighs 10 pounds.
One in every thousand imps possesses the ability to 
communicate telepathically with creatures within 50 feet 
and the power to change its form into that of any Small 
or Tiny animal, as per the spell beast shape II. These imp 
consulars are highly prized by powerful devils, who send 
them to serve their favored minions or to corrupt mortals 
with great destinies. An imp consular can be summoned 
via the Improved Familiar feat, but only by a spellcaster of 
8th level or higher. Diabolists tell of other breeds of imps 
with similarly specialized abilities, but if such creatures 
truly exist they are an especially rare lot.
Unlike most devils, imps often find themselves free 
and alone on the Material Plane, particularly after they’ve 
been summoned to serve as familiars and their masters 
have perished (often indirectly due to the machinations of 
the imp itself ). With no way to return home, these 
imps, freed of their bonds to arcane masters, can 
become dangerous pests or even leaders of small 
tribes of savage humanoids like goblins 
or kobolds.

The least of devilkind, lemures roil forth from the ranks 
of souls damned to Hell, shapeless masses of quivering 
f lesh. What spark of instinct or memory lingers on 
within a lemure’s semi-consciousness regularly shapes its 
features to mimic those of its tormentors or the tortured 
souls around it. Grotesque and useless, a lemure’s 
features speak nothing of what it once was. Many 
exhibit multiple terrible visages or are nothing more 
than churning pillars of cancerous f lesh. Only their 
knobby, f lailing limbs work as they should, and those 
they merely use to destroy any non-infernal life that 
draws too near. Moving lemures typically congeal 
in forms over 4 feet tall and weigh upward of 200 
pounds, though when at rest these disgusting fiends 
often appear to be little more than lumps of melted 
f lesh and malformed features.
Although among the most loathsome creatures 
in existence, lemures serve a vital role in Hell’s 
perverse ecology. When at the end of a mortal life 
a creature’s soul is damned—whether because it 
revered diabolical forces or failed in the worship of 
another deity—it joins the masses of suffering souls 
filling the plains of Avernus, Hell’s first layer. Here a 
soul’s torments begin as lesser devils marshal it along 
with similar spirits in preparation for a long, perilous 

journey to one of Hell’s deeper layers—typically one 
suited to the punishments appropriate to the soul’s 
crimes, or merely the domain of a devil who has need for 
slaves. Upon reaching the realm of their damnation, souls 
face untold lifetimes of torment at the hands of devils, 
other fiendish beings, and the deadly machinations of 
Hell itself. As the formerly mortal essences slowly go 
mad, they forget their lives, grow bestial, and eventually 
become little more than automatons of fear and hatred. 
After ages of such existence, the cruel processes of Hell 
either utterly annihilate the soul or—in the cases of the 
most profane spirits—reconsecrate such forsaken beings 
into lemures, the building blocks of devils, unthinking 
waves of filth and diabolical f lesh. Such repulsive beings 
assemble in vast mobs, waves of putrescence thousands 
upon thousands strong. Greater devils can spot the most 
corrupt of these fiends and, either through mysterious 
tortures or the powers of Hell itself, reshape them into 
true devils, newly born and ready to obediently serve in 
the legions of the damned.

A roiling wave of f lesh gushes forward. Amid the fatty surge 
wriggle half-formed limbs and a dripping tumorous face.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Devil Shaping (Su) Three times per day, a pit fiend can 
spend a minute to transform nearby lemures into other 
lesser devils. A pit fiend can transform one lemure for 
every Hit Die the pit fiend possesses. It can then reshape 
these lemures into a number of Hit Dice’s worth of lesser 
devils (see page 71) equal to the number of lemures 
affected. For example, a typical 20 Hit Dice pit fiend 
could transform 20 lemures into two bone devils (10 
HD each), or three bearded devils (6 HD each, leaving 
two lemures unchanged), or any other combination of 
lesser devils. Lemures to be reshaped must be within 50 
feet of the pit fiend, becoming stationary and unable to 
move once the shaping begins. After a minute passes, the 
lemures reform into the shape of a new lesser devil ready 
to follow the orders of the pit fiend. Although pit fiends 
can, technically, elevate a mass of 20 lemures into a new 
pit fiend, most are hesitant to do so since they have no 
special control over a devil created in this manner.

Rulers of infernal realms, generals of Hell’s armies, 
and advisors to the archfiends, pit fiends embody the 
awesome and terrible pinnacle of devilkind. Massive, 
physically indomitable, and possessed of ingenious 
evil intellects, these diabolical tyrants hold great 
autonomy whether in their service to the archfiends, in 
their rule of vast infernal fiefdoms, or in subjugation 
of mortal worlds. Thick muscles cling to their gigantic 
frames, armored over by dense, bladed scales capable 
of def lecting all but the most potent assaults. Fangs 
as thick as daggers fill their maws, bestial visages 
disguising some of the most insidious minds in Hell. 
Born within the depths of Nessus, the ninth and 
deepest layer of Hell, pit fiends are raised from the 
ranks of cornugons and gelugons by the archdevils and 
their dukes alone. While many travel to higher layers 
and far from Hell to command infernal legions, most 
remain in Nessus serving in the courts of Hell’s elite or 
in dark councils with unknowable purposes. Pit fiends 
always stand over 14 feet tall, with wingspans in excess 
of 20 feet and weights over 1,000 pounds.
Pit fiends are masters of fire and prefer lands bathed 
in f lame. In Hell, this predisposes them to Avernus, Dis, 
Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon the layers most likely 
to harbor their burning temple-citadels. Fanatics obsessed 
with diabolical superiority and ironclad obedience, pit 
fiends left to their own devices raise massive armies, 

DDeevviill,, PPit Fiend

it Fiend

scouring the pits of Hell for the most depraved lemures 
to transform into true fiends. When convinced they’ve 
formed the perfect legions, they turn their attentions to 
vulnerable demiplanes and mortal worlds, eyeing them 
for infernal domination and the glory of conquest. In 
the service of the archfiends or other unique infernal 
warlords, pit fiends hold themselves to a greater cause, 
obeying the wills of Asmodeus’s chosen nobles in the 
hopes of one day garnering the favor of either the Prince of 
Darkness or Hell itself. While obedient to the hierarchies 
of their kind, they are also strict in their enforcement, and 
should a pit fiend find itself subservient to a master 
unfit to rule, it holds itself duty bound to cast down 
such an incompetent lord. Thus, whether as masters or 
servants, pit fiends embody the will of Hell’s merciless 
law and assure that only the strongest of devilkind 
f lourish (or dare to). 
Only the most powerful of mortal spellcasters can 
or dare summon a pit fiend. These devils’ reactions to 
summoning are deliberate and swift, usually typified by 
overwhelming rage that such insignificant beings would 
waste their immortal time. Those that cannot weather 
the devils’ burning rage are slain—their souls typically 
racing the pit fiends back to Hell. Those who manage 
to keep control of the greater devils, though, 
intrigue them. A pit fiend might dutifully serve 
a mortal master for centuries, but its goal is 
always the same: to further corrupt the mortal 
soul, assure its absolute damnation, and when 
the mortal  inevitably dies, claim its soul and begin the 
process of creating a perfectly corrupt lemure servant. 
Pit fiends know they are immortal and are intelligent 
enough to indulge in impossibly disciplined patience. 
As such, the eldest pit fiends see in their legions 
the faces of countless fools who once presumed 
themselves the devils’ masters.
Infernal Dukes
The most powerful of pit fiends are lords in their own 
right—members of the elite caste of infernal politics and 
leadership known as the Dukes of Hell. While not all of 
the Dukes of Hell are pit fiends, the majority of them 
are. As a general rule, a pit fiend Duke of Hell has several 
levels of a particular character class, the advanced simple 
template, or in some cases unusual spell-like abilities or 
unique powers over and above those of most pit fiends. 
Listed here are three sample unique pit fiend duke 
abilities, but these examples are by no means the entirety 
of what strange powers an infernal duke might wield.
Deathmastery (Su): The pit fiend duke’s ability to 
manipulate the souls of the damned extends beyond the 
standard devil shaping power. Whenever a pit fiend 
slays a humanoid, it can attempt to transform the slain 

creature’s soul into a ghost under the pit fiend’s control. 
The pit fiend may control a number of ghosts in this 
manner equal to its Charisma modifier.
Master of Magic (Su): The pit fiend duke has additional 
spell-like abilities (20 spell levels’ worth of 1st–4th level 
spells usable at will and 20 spell levels’ worth of 5th–8th 
level spells usable 3 times a day).
Hellfire Breath (Su): The pit fiend gains a devastating 
breath weapon that it can use once every 1d4 rounds. This 
breath weapon is a 60-foot cone of fire (10d10 fire damage 
and 10d10 unholy damage as per f lame strike, successful 
Ref lex save [DC 10 + 1/2 the pit fiend’s racial HD + the pit

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Devour Soul (Su) By making a touch attack as a standard action, 
a devourer can deal 12d6+18 points of damage as if using a 
slay living spell. A DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this damage 
to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes 
trapped within the devourer’s chest. The creature cannot 
be brought back to life until the devourer’s destruction (or a 
spell deflection—see below) releases its soul. A devourer can 
hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides 
a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed 
by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when 
it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell’s level (for sake of 
ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in its 
stats to the left in superscript). At the start of an encounter, 
a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. 
The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level 
for every 5 points of essence drained—these negative levels 
remain if the creature is brought back to life (but 
they do not stack with any negative levels imparted 
by being brought back to life). A soul that is 
completely consumed may only be restored 
to life by a miracle or wish. The save DC is 
Charisma-based.
Spell Deflection (Su) If any of the 
following spells are cast at the devourer 
and overcome its spell resistance, they 
instead affect a devoured soul: banishment, 
chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, 
detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate 
person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, 
hypnotism, imprisonment, magic 
jar, maze, suggestion, trap the 
soul, or any form of charm 
or compulsion. While none 
of these effects harms the 
soul, the caster makes a DC 25 
caster level check when a spell 
is deflected—success indicates 
that the trapped soul is released 
from its prison and the creature 
whose body it belonged to can 
now be restored to life as normal.
Devourers are the undead 
remnants of fiends and evil 
spellcasters who became lost 
beyond the farthest reaches of 
the multiverse. Returning with 
warped bodies, alien sentience, 
and a hunger for life, devourers threaten 
all souls with a terrifying, tormented 
annihilation. These withered corpses stand 
10 feet tall but weigh a mere 200 pounds.

This dry, hovering corpse’s chest is a prison of jagged ribs, within 
which is trapped a small tormented ghostly form.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Stun (Ex) The ankylosaurus’s tail can deliver a powerful, 
stunning blow. A creature struck by this attack must make a 
DC 23 save or be dazed for 1 round. If the strike is a critical 
hit and the target fails its save, it is instead stunned for 1d4 
rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
The ankylosaurus is a powerful, squat dinosaur more 
than capable of defending itself against enemies. Its back 
is heavily armored with thick bony plates and spikes. A 
solid blow from an ankylosaurus’s tail can leave most 
creatures stunned long enough for the armored dinosaur 
to make good an escape, although once confronted, most 
ankylosauruses are too ill-tempered and stubborn to f lee. 
Instead, they stand their ground and use their tails to 
great effect in battle. An ankylosaurus is 30 feet long and 
weighs 6,000 pounds.

The normal dog statistics presented here 
describe any small dog of about 20–50 
pounds in weight. They can also 
be used for small wild canines 
such as coyotes, jackals, and 
feral dogs.
In the wild, dogs are vicious 
and territorial creatures. Yet even 
more harrowing than a pack of wild 
dogs is the rabid dog. Rabies often 
affects animals like bats, wolverines, 
and rats, but the transformation of a 
normally friendly family pet goes through 
when it becomes rabid makes the dog 
perhaps the most notorious of the disease’s 
classic carriers.
A rabid creature can transmit rabies to a victim 
with a bite. Its CR increases by 1 (or up one step, in the 
case of a creature whose CR is less than 1).

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Mimicry (Ex) A doppelganger is proficient 
in all weapons, armor, and shields. In 
addition, a doppelganger can use any 
spell trigger or spell completion item 
as if the spells were on its spell list. 
Its caster level is equal to its racial 
Hit Dice.
Perfect Copy (Su) When a 
doppelganger uses change shape, 
it can assume the appearance of 
specific individuals.
Doppelgangers are strange beings 
that can take on the shapes of 
those they encounter. In its natural 
form, the creature looks more or 
less humanoid, but slender and frail, with 
gangly limbs and half-formed facial 

Doppelganger
This grayish humanoid creature seems almost unfinished, with a 
narrow head, gaunt limbs, and a sinister, noseless face.

features. Its f lesh is pale and hairless, and its eyes are 
vacant and white.
Doppelgangers prefer infiltrating societies where they 
can gather wealth and inf luence, and see little point in 
forming cities of their own kind. Younger doppelgangers 
practice their skills by taking over small orc or goblin tribes, 
then move to more complicated societies like dwarven, elven, 
and human communities. Rather than making themselves 
targets by taking positions of leadership, they prefer to be 
the power behind the throne, or use multiple identities to 
manipulate inf luential citizens or entire guilds.
Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural 
mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate 
humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are 
interested only in themselves and regard all others as 
playthings to be manipulated and deceived. They are 
particularly fond of invading human societies in order to 
indulge in their desires—some enjoy the complex dance of 
politics while others seek constant change in the race and 
gender of both themselves and their romantic companions. 
While not standard, it is those doppelgangers use their gifts 
for cruel and sadistic purposes that are most notorious, and 
these shapeshifters are the primary cause of the race’s 
sinister reputation. Certainly, a creature capable of 
changing its shape has a handy way to avoid capture 
for its crimes, and some particularly malicious 
doppelgangers enjoy disrupting relationships by 
posing as unfaithful lovers.
Rumors persist of even more powerful 
doppelgangers capable of not only 
shifting their appearance, but 
also skills, memories, and 
even the extraordinary and 
supernatural abilities of 
creatures whose forms 
they choose to mimic. 
These doppelgangers’ 
change shape ability 
functions like the 
spell polymorph rather 
than alter self.

Dragon
True dragons are divided into two broad categories: chromatic 
and metallic. Chromatic dragons are almost universally evil, 
seeking only to slake their endless lust for food, treasure, 
and bloodshed. Metallic dragons are generally good and 
often protect the lands under their care.
aGe	CateGories
Many of a true dragon’s abilities, attacks, and other statistics 
improve as a dragon grows older. These increases are divided 
into 12 age categories—as a dragon ages, its base statistics 
change as noted on the Dragon Age Categories table.
Age Category: This is the age category’s name.
Age in Years: This is the dragon’s actual age.
CR: This column modifies the dragon’s base CR.
Size: This shows how many size categories by which to 
increase the dragon’s base size, depending on its age (from 
Tiny to Small, Small to Medium, and so on). A true dragon 
does not gain the standard increases to ability scores when 
it achieves a larger size—instead, true dragons gain ability 
score increases according to their age category, as indicated 
on the Dragon Ability Scores table.
Hit Dice: This shows how many additional Hit Dice a 
dragon gains over its base Hit Dice as it grows. Increases 
to Hit Dice grant extra hit points, feats, and skill ranks as 
well as increase the dragon’s base attack bonus and base 
save bonuses. Dragons have skill ranks equal to 6 + their 
Intelligence modifier per Hit Die. A dragon’s increases to 
ability scores for gaining Hit Dice are included in the total 
ability score increases (see the Dragon Ability Scores table).
Natural Armor: This shows by what amount the dragon’s 
base natural armor bonus increases with each age category.
Breath Weapon: Each dragon has a breath weapon (see 
Combat) that deals a base amount of damage. This multiplier 
increases the number of dice of damage dealt by the dragon’s 
breath weapon. For example, a mature adult dragon with a 
base breath weapon that deals 2d6 acid damage would deal 
14d6 acid damage (due to the ×7 multiplier).
CoMbat
The Dragon Attacks and Speeds table lists the attacks 
a dragon can employ and the damage it deals (a dash 
indicates that a dragon of that size does not possess that 
natural attack). Other abilities described here are gained 
by dragons when they reach a specific age category.
Fly Speed: A dragon’s f ly speed increases as indicated, 
according to its size.
Bite: This is a primary attack that deals the indicated 
damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon’s Strength bonus (even 
though it has more than one attack). A dragon’s bite attack 
has reach as if the creature were one size category larger 
(+10 feet for Colossal dragons).

Claws: These primary attacks deal the indicated damage 
plus the dragon’s Strength bonus.
Wings: The dragon can slam foes with its wings, even 
when flying. Wing attacks are secondary attacks that deal 
the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon’s Strength bonus.
Tail Slap: The dragon can slap one foe each round with its 
tail. A tail slap is a secondary attack that deals the indicated 
damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon’s Strength bonus (this is 
an exception to the normal secondary attack rules).
Crush (Ex): A f lying or jumping Huge or larger dragon 
can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body 
to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against 
opponents three or more size categories smaller than the 
dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the 
dragon’s space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed 
on a Ref lex save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s breath 
weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning 
damage during the next round unless the dragon moves 
off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must 
succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned 
foes take damage from the crush each round if they don’t 
escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 
1-1/2 times the dragon’s Strength bonus.
Tail Sweep (Ex): This allows a Gargantuan or larger 
dragon to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The 
sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet 
for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on 
the edge of the dragon’s space in any direction. Creatures 
within the swept area are affected if they are four or more 
size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep 
automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times 
the dragon’s Strength bonus (round down). Affected 
creatures can attempt Ref lex saves to take half damage (DC 
equal to that of the dragon’s breath weapon).
Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard 
action. A dragon can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 
rounds, even if it possesses more than one breath weapon. 
A breath weapon always starts at an intersection adjacent 
to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon’s 
choice. Breath weapons come in two shapes, lines and cones, 
whose areas vary with the dragon’s size. If a breath weapon 
deals damage, those caught in the area can attempt Ref lex 
saves to take half damage. The save DC against a breath 
weapon is 10 + 1/2 dragon’s HD + dragon’s Con modifier. 
Saves against various breath weapons use the same DC; the 
type of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. A 
dragon can use its breath weapon when it is grappling or 
being grappled. 
Additional Dragon Rules
Dragon Senses (Ex): Dragons have have darkvision 120 
ft. and blindsense 60 ft. They see four times as well as a 
human in dim light and twice as well in normal light.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid Pool (Su) An ancient or older black dragon can use its 
breath weapon to create an acid pool as a standard action. 
This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per age category of 
the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside 
its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon’s 
breath weapon (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn 
touching this pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save 
for half. Each round, the total damage dice of the pool is 
halved until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid pool 
floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface.
Acidic Bite (Su) At old age, a black dragon’s bite deals an 
additional 2d6 points of acid damage. An ancient dragon’s 
damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym’s to 6d6.
Charm Reptiles (Sp) A great wyrm black dragon can use this 
ability three times per day. It works as a mass charm monster 
spell that affects only reptilian animals. This ability is the 
equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day an adult or older black 
dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water, making it 
foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability 
spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items 
(such as potions) and items in a creature’s possession must 
succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon’s frightful 
presence) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent 
of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon’s 
frightful presence.
Speak with Reptiles (Sp) A young or older black dragon gains the 
constant spell-like ability to speak with reptiles. This functions 
as speak with animals, but only with reptilian animals.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A black dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed 
age category. Juvenile—darkness (radius 10 feet per age 
category); Old—plant growth; Ancient—insect plague.
Swamp Stride (Ex) A very young or older black dragon can 
move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its 
normal speed.

Hissing green acid drips from the fanged maw of this black-
scaled, horned dragon.

Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater 
indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and 
other abilities while submerged.

Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black 
dragons are the undisputed masters of their domain, ruling 
through cruelty and intimidation. Those who dwell within 
a black dragon’s reach live in fear. Black dragons tend to 
make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in 
caves at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile 
up their filthy treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck. 
Black dragons prefer their food a bit rotten and will often 
allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before consuming 
it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or 
decay, making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, 
jewelry, and other objects made from stone or metal.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Desert Thirst (Su) A blue dragon can cast create water at will 
(CL equals its HD). Alternatively, it can destroy an equal 
amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids 
are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items 
(such as potions) and items in a creature’s possession 
must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon’s 
breath weapon) or be destroyed.
Electricity Aura (Su) An adult blue dragon is surrounded by an 
aura of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of 
electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon’s turn. An 
old dragon’s aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon’s 
damage increases to 2d6.
Mirage (Su) An old or older blue dragon can make itself 
appear to be in two places at once as a free action for 
a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This 
ability functions as project image but the dragon can use 
its breath weapon through the mirage.
Sandstorm (Su) As a standard action, a great wyrm blue 
dragon can create a sandstorm centered on itself with a 
radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the dragon inside 
the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition 
to the normal sandstorm penalties (Pathfinder RPG Core 
Rulebook 431). This sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can 
be dismissed by the dragon as a free action. 
Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can 
mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful 
Bluff check against a listener’s Sense Motive check.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A blue dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed 
age category. Young—ghost sound; Juvenile—minor image; 
Adult—ventriloquism; Old—hallucinatory terrain; Ancient—
veil; Great wyrm—mirage arcana.
Storm Breath (Su) An ancient or older blue dragon can use its 
breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions 
as call lightning storm, but the damage is equal to the 
dragon’s breath weapon. The dragon can call down 1 bolt

orderly. In combat, blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if 
possible, and are not above retreating if the odds turn 
against them. They prefer to lair near those that 
they control, sometimes even within the confines 
of a city.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Awaken Treants (Su) A great wyrm dragon can call on the forest 
itself to aid it, animating a number of trees to serve as treants 
to protect it. These treants can be called from any Huge or 
larger living tree. A green dragon can create a single treant 
as a standard action, up to a total of 4 treants per day. These 
treants remain animated for up to 1 hour, at which time they 
revert to being ordinary trees. 
Camouflage (Ex) An old or older green dragon can use Stealth 
to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does 
not grant cover or concealment.
Miasma (Su) An ancient or older green dragon can use its 
breath weapon to create a cloud of acid as a standard action 
that deals damage to any creature inside it. The cloud moves 
with the dragon and has a radius of 20 feet. When it’s 
created, anyone inside this area takes an amount of damage 
equal to half the dragon’s breath weapon, with a Reflex save 
for half damage. The number of damage dice rolled is halved 
each round until the result would be less than 1d6. Any 
creature that starts its turn inside the cloud takes damage, 
but can make a Reflex save for half. A strong wind, such as 
that created by a gust of wind, disperses the cloud in 1 round.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A green dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed 
age category. Young—entangle; Juvenile—charm person; 
Adult—suggestion; Old—plant growth; Ancient—dominate 
person; Great wyrm—command plants.
Trackless Step (Ex) An adult or older green dragon does not leave 
a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. A green 
dragon can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires.
Water Breathing (Ex) A green dragon can breathe underwater 
indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and 
other abilities while submerged.
Woodland Stride (Ex) A very young or older green dragon 
can move through any sort of foliage at full speed without 
taking damage or suffering impairment. Areas of foliage 
that have been magically manipulated affect it normally.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
fire Aura (Su) An adult red dragon is surrounded by an aura 
of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points 
of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon’s turn. An 
old dragon’s aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon’s 
damage increases to 2d6.
Incinerate (Su) A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures 
in its fiery breath. A creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points 
by its breath weapon must make a Fortitude save (using the 
breath weapon’s DC). Failure indicates that the creature is 
reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only be 
restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic. 
Manipulate flames (Su) An old or older red dragon can control 
any fire spell within 10 feet per age category of the dragon 
as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire 
effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also 
allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the 
new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 
round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control 
any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were 
the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, 
including canceling the spell if it so desires.
Melt Stone (Su) An ancient or older red dragon can use its 
breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting  
a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The area becomes 
lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the 
lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 
10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens 
and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an 
avalanche that deals fire damage.
Smoke Vision (Ex) A very young red dragon can see perfectly 
in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A red dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed 
age category. Young—detect magic; Juvenile—pyrotechnics; 
Adult—suggestion; Old—wall of fire; Ancient—find the path; 
Great wyrm—discern location.

A crown of cruel horns surrounds the head of this mighty dragon.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blizzard (Su) An ancient white dragon can use its breath 
weapon to create a blizzard in the area around it as a 
standard action. This creates heavy snow conditions in a 
50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This 
snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square 
entered) and limits vision as fog does.
Cold Aura (Su) An adult white dragon radiates an aura of cold. 
All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points 
of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon’s turn. An 
old dragon’s aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon’s 
damage increases to 2d6.
freezing fog (Sp) An old white dragon can use this ability 
three times per day. It is similar to an acid fog spell but 
deals cold damage instead of acid damage. It also causes a 
rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, 
creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune 
to the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This 
ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.
Ice Shape (Su) A young white dragon can shape ice and 
snow at will. This ability functions as stone shape, but only 
targeting ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon’s caster 
level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.
Ice Tomb (Sp) A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a 
creature to sink into ice. This works as imprisonment, but only 
while the target is touching an icy surface. A white dragon 
can use this ability once per day (CL equals dragon’s HD). 
Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting 
freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice 
(Hardness 0, 360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based. 
Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but 
the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can 
move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need 
to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.
Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see 
perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not 
suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.

Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A white dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities usable at will upon reaching the listed age

Although most consider it to be the weakest and most 
feral of the chromatic dragons, the white dragon makes 
up for its lack of cunning with sheer ferocity. White 
dragons dwell on remote, frozen mountaintops and in 
arctic lowlands, making their home in glittering caves 
full of ice and snow. They prefer their meals 
completely frozen.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Desert Wind (Su) A juvenile or older brass dragon can call up 
the desert wind to serve him. This functions as gust of wind, 
but any creature in its path must make a Fortitude save or 
be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand. The save DC for this 
effect is equal to the dragon’s breath weapon DC.
fire Aura (Su) An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by 
an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 5 feet of the 
dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of 
the dragon’s turn. An ancient brass dragon’s aura extends 
to 10 feet. A great wyrm’s damage increases to 2d6. A 
brass dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a 
free action.
Move Sand (Sp) A young or older brass dragon can move sand 
to excavate ruins or hide treasures. This functions as move 
earth, but it only affects sand. The dragon uses his HD in 
place of his caster level for this effect. This is equivalent to a 
5th-level spell.
Sandstorm (Su) An ancient or older brass dragon can create 
a powerful sandstorm once per day as a full-round action. 
This storm has a radius of 1 mile and lasts for 1 minute per 
age category of the dragon. This functions as a sandstorm 
(Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431), except that it is also 
accompanied by windstorm-level winds.
Sleep Breath (Su) Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can 
breathe a cone of sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must 
succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1d6 rounds plus 1 
round per age category of the dragon.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A brass dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed 
age category. Very young—speak with animals; Juvenile—
endure elements; Adult—suggestion; Old—control winds; 
Ancient—control weather; Great wyrm—whirlwind.
Summon Djinni (Sp) This ability, usable by a great wyrm brass 
dragon once per day, works like a summon monster spell, 
except that it summons one noble djinni. This ability is the 
equivalent of a 9th-level spell. 

A crest of horns sweeps back from the head of this dragon, leading 
to a long neck and serpentine brass body.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A young or older bronze dragon can take 
any animal or humanoid form 3/day as if using polymorph. 
Electricity Aura (Su) An old or older bronze dragon has an aura 
of electricity. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of 
electricity damage at the start of the dragon’s turn. An ancient 
dragon’s aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm’s damage increases to 
2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.
Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze 
dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must 
make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move 
away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age 
category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A bronze dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age 
category. Very young—speak with animals; Juvenile—create 
food and water; Adult—fog cloud; Old—detect thoughts; 
Ancient—control water; Great wyrm—control weather.
Tidal Wave (Su) A great wyrm bronze dragon can cause the sea 
to rise up and crush his enemies once per day as a standard 
action. This affects an area of coastline 120 feet in length 
and targets all creatures within 40 feet of the shore—treat 
the targets as if struck by an avalanche (Pathfinder RPG 
Core Rulebook 429). Treat all creatures as if they were in the 
bury zone. The save DC to halve this damage is equal to the 
dragon’s breath weapon DC. Those who fail their saves take 
full damage and are drawn 60 feet off shore and deposited 20 
feet under the surface on the round after the wave hits.
Vortex (Ex) Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon 
can create a vortex as a standard action, just like an elder 
water elemental (see page 127). A bronze dragon can 
maintain this vortex for 1 round per age category.
Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can 
use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater.
Wave Mastery (Su) For up to 10 minutes per age category per 
day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels 
within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.

This sleek dragon is covered in dull metallic scales that range in 
color from shining bronze to mottled blue.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Change Shape (Su) A very young or older gold dragon can 
assume any animal or humanoid form three times per day 
as if using polymorph.
Detect gems (Sp) A young or older gold dragon can detect 
gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, 
but can only be used to locate gemstones.
Divine Aid (Sp) Once a week, a great wyrm gold dragon can call 
upon celestial powers for aid. This functions as a miracle. 
fast flight (Ex) A young or older gold dragon is treated as one 
size category larger when determining his fly speed.
fire Aura (Su) An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an 
aura of fire. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 
points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon’s turn. 
An ancient gold dragon’s aura extends to 10 feet. A great 
wyrm’s damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or 
suppress this aura as a free action.
Luck (Sp) Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can 
touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon’s hide, 
and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon 
carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given 
radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus 
on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem 
to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The 
effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the 
dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A gold dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities upon reaching the listed age category. Its 
caster level for these effects is equal to its Hit Dice, and any 
save DCs are Charisma-based. A gold dragon can use these 
abilities at will. Very young—detect evil; Juvenile—bless; 
Adult—daylight; Old—geas/quest; Ancient—sunburst; Great 
wyrm—foresight.
Weakening Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon 
can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the 
cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of 
Strength damage per age category (Will save half).

Golden scales cover the body of this majestic dragon, and a regal 
crest of horns arches backward above wise and piercing eyes.

Change Shape (Su) A silver dragon can assume any animal or 
humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.
Cloudwalking (Su) A very young or older silver dragon can 
tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground.
Cold Aura (Su) An old or older silver dragon is surrounded by an 
aura of cold. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 
points of cold damage at the beginning of the dragon’s turn. 
An ancient dragon’s aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm’s 
aura damage increases to 2d6. A silver dragon can suppress or 
activate this aura at will as a free action.
fog Vision (Ex) A juvenile or older silver dragon can see 
perfectly well in fog and clouds.
graceful flight (Ex) A young or older silver dragon’s aerial 
maneuverability is one step better than normal.
Paralyzing Breath (Su) Instead of a cone of cold, a silver dragon 
can breathe a cone of paralyzing gas. Creatures within the 
cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 
1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.
Reflective Scales (Su) Any spell that targets an ancient or older 
silver dragon but fails to penetrate the silver dragon’s spell 
resistance might be reflected. If the caster level check to 
penetrate the dragon’s spell resistance is failed by 5 or more, 
the spell is reflected. If the check fails by 4 or less, the spell is 
merely wasted. This otherwise functions as spell turning.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A silver dragon gains the following 
spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed 
age category. Very young—detect evil; Juvenile—feather 
fall; Adult—fog cloud; Old—control winds; Ancient—control 
weather; Great wyrm—reverse gravity.
True Courage (Ex) A great wyrm silver dragon can fight on 
through pain and death. When reduced to below 0 hit 
points, it remains conscious, automatically stabilizes, and 
can continue to act (although it is staggered). If it takes 
damage or is the target of a spell that causes its death, it 
remains alive for 1 round and can act normally (it is not 
staggered for this final round).

and 50 feet long, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 12d6 
fire, Reflex DC 20 half; effective both on the surface and 
underwater. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Capsize (Ex) A dragon turtle can attempt to capsize a boat or 
ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a 
CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the 
result of the boat captain’s Profession 
(sailor) check, whichever is higher. For 
each size category larger than the 
dragon turtle’s size, it takes a 
cumulative –10 penalty on this 
CMB check.
Dragon turtles make their 
homes in both salt and 
fresh water, where they rank 
among the biggest threats to 
sailors and those who travel by 

Dragon Turtle
This long-tailed aquatic beast resembles a massive snapping 
turtle with draconic features.

ship through the waterways of the world. Skilled mariners 
know the territory dragon turtles claim and frequently 
make offerings of gold and magic for safe passage or avoid 
the area entirely. For its part, a dragon turtle quickly 
grows to appreciate and even expect such tithes and gifts, 
and a dragon turtle that expects gifts but is ignored is a 
dangerous foe indeed.
A dragon turtle’s shell varies in color between 
individuals. Some have dull shells of brown and rust red, 
while others have carapaces of a deep green-blue color with 
silver highlights across the rocky ridges. The coloration of 
the head, tail, and legs is slightly paler than the shell and 
contains golden streaks along the crest and spines.
Dragon turtles claim vast territories in the open seas, 
encompassing regions often in excess of 50 square miles. 
Here, these dangerous beasts capsize ships that fail 
to respect their territories, adding the sunken wrecks 
and their valuable cargoes to their lairs. Dragon turtles 
generally make their homes in deep caves only accessible 
through the water, and often decorate their lairs not only 
with the wealth seized from ships they’ve sunk, but the 
wrecks of these unfortunate ships themselves. Their 
territorial natures and fondness for these types of lairs 
put them in direct conf lict with other undersea races 
such as merfolk and sahuagin. 
Large fish, such as tuna, sturgeons, and even 
sharks, rank among dragon turtles’ favorite foods, but 
being omnivores, they also sometimes feed on large 
undersea fields of seaweed. They certainly aren’t above 
supplementing their diets with the passengers of ships 
they sink, although such feeding is not borne of any

Drider
The dry rasping of spidery legs brings this hideous monstrosity 
into view—a nightmarish, centaurian fusion of drow and spider.

Spells A drider casts spells as a 6th-level cleric, sorcerer, or 
wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities.
Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a drider is Large, 
its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium 
humanoid’s upper torso. As a result, it wields weapons 
as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size 
(Medium for most driders).
Created from the body of a drow, warped and mutated through 
special poisons and elixirs to take on the characteristics of a 
giant spider, the drider is a dangerous creature.
Driders are sexually dimorphic. A female drider’s 
lower spider body is sleek and graceful, often similar to 
a black widow’s body, while its upper drow torso retains 
its alluring curves and beautiful face (with the exception 
of sharp, poisonous fangs). A male drider’s lower body is 
bulky like a tarantula, while its upper body is wiry and 
bears a hideous face more spider than drow, complete 
with fanged mandibles.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison Use (Ex) Drow are skilled in the use of poison and never 
risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Drow favor an insidious 
toxin that causes its victims to lapse into unconsciousness—
this poison allows drow to capture slaves with great ease. 
Drow Poison—injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/minute for 2 
minutes; initial effect unconsciousness for 1 minute; secondary

Although related to the elves, the drow are a vile and evil 
cousin at best. Sometimes called dark elves, these cunning 
creatures prowl the caves and tunnels of the world below, 
ruling vast subterranean cities through fear and might. 
Worshiping demons and enslaving most races they 
encounter, the drow are among the underworld’s most 
feared and hated denizens.
Drow are shorter and a bit more slender than their 
surface-dwelling kin, but they are otherwise physically 

Drow
This dark-skinned elf stands in a battle-ready pose, her hair silver 
and eyes white and pupilless.

similar. Drow have dark skin, ranging from black to a hazy 
purple hue. Most drow have white or silver hair and white 
or red eyes, but other colors are not unheard of.
Drow society is ruled over by powerful nobility, 
themselves governed by sadistic and dangerous matriarchs 
who constantly plot and scheme against rival houses and 
lesser kin within their own families. The majority of drow 
are the common soldiers and decadent citizenry, with base 
stats as presented here—drow nobles are more powerful 
and dangerous, and are detailed on the facing page.
In combat, drow are thoroughly ruthless, with little 
regard for fairness or mercy. They prefer to attack from 
ambush or to lure enemies into situations where they 
clearly have the upper hand. If things turn against them, 
drow are quick to f lee, leaving slaves and minions to cover 
their escape.
Drow Characters
Drow are defined by their class levels—they do not possess 
racial Hit Dice. All drow have the following racial traits.
+2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, –2 Constitution: Drow are 
nimble and manipulative.
Medium: Drow are Medium creatures, and have no 
bonuses or penalties due to their size.
Normal Speed: Drow have a base speed of 30 feet.
Darkvision: Drow can see in the dark up to 120 feet.
Drow Immunities: Drow are immune to magic 
sleep effects and get a +2 racial bonus to saves against 
enchantment spells.
Keen Senses: Drow receive a +2 racial bonus on 
Perception checks.
Spell Resistance: Drow possess spell resistance equal to 
6 plus their class levels.
Spell-Like Abilities: A drow can cast dancing lights, 
darkness, and faerie fire each once per day, using his total 
character level as his caster level.
Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds 
drow for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled 
as long as they remain in the affected area.
Poison Use: See Special Abilities, above.
Weapon Familiarity: Drow are proficient with the hand 
crossbow, rapier, and short sword.
Languages: Drow begin play speaking Elven and 
Undercommon. Drow with high Intelligence can choose 
bonus languages from the following: Abyssal, Aklo, Aquan, 
Common, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, or Goblin.
Drow Nobility
About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special 
powers from birth—the overwhelming majority of these 
exceptional drow are female, and as a result, drow society 
tends to be matriarchal in nature. These special births are 
engineered and encouraged among the ruling caste, and are

Drow

Drow

far more likely to occur when the mother is of noble heritage. 
Strangely, the status of the father seems not to increase or 
decrease the chances of a child being born a drow noble. 
Common drow children born to nobles are usually put 
to death—sacrificed to one of the many demon gods to 
whom the drow offer worship. It is rare for a drow noble 
to be born to common parents, but those who are usually 
murder their parents or family before they come of age in 
order to hide the truth of their base upbringing and to ease 
the processes of joining one of their society’s noble houses. 
Drow nobles are more powerful than the majority of their 
kin, and as such they quickly rise to power within their 
houses. Advancement through the hierarchy of a drow noble 
house is usually accomplished through a combination of 
assassination, seduction, and treachery, leading most drow 
in power to be overly paranoid.
Drow Noble Characters
Drow nobles are defined by their class levels—they do not 
possess racial Hit Dice. A drow noble’s challenge rating 
is equal to her class level. Drow nobles possess all 
of the racial traits listed above for drow characters, 
plus the following.
+4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, 
+2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, –2 
Constitution. Noble drow 
are very agile, observant, 
and regal. These ability 
score modifiers replace the 
standard drow ability score 
modifiers.
Spell Resistance: 
Drow nobles have spell 
resistance equal to 11 + 
their character level.
Spell-Like Abilities: 
Drow nobles can cast 
dancing lights, deeper 
darkness, faerie 
fire, feather fall, 
and levitate 
each at will, 
and have detect 
magic as a constant 
spell-like ability. A 
drow noble can also 
cast divine favor, dispel 
magic, and suggestion 
once per day each. In 
some cases, a drow noble’s 
spell-like abilities might vary, 
although the level of a particular spell-
like ability does not. A drow noble’s 

caster level for her spell-like abilities is equal to her 
character level.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Tree Meld (Su) A dryad can meld with any tree, similar to how 
the spell meld into stone functions. She can remain melded 
with a tree as long as she wishes.
Tree Dependent (Su) A dryad is mystically bonded to a single, 
enormous tree and must never stray more than 300 yards 
from it. Most dryad trees are oak trees, but other trees 
function as well (often having subtle influences on a specific 
dryad’s personality and appearance). A dryad who moves 
300 yards beyond her bonded tree immediately becomes 
sickened. Every hour thereafter, she must make a DC 15 
Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. A 
dryad that is out of range of her bonded tree for 24 hours 
takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 
points of Constitution damage every day that follows—

This strange, beautiful woman has f lesh that seems made of 
wood and vibrant hair that resembles leaves and blossoms.

eventually, this separation kills the dryad. A dryad can forge 
a new bond with a new tree by performing a 24-hour ritual 
and making a successful DC 20 Will save.
Wild Empathy (Su) This works like the druid’s wild empathy 
class feature, except the dryad has a +6 racial bonus on the 
check. Dryads with druid levels add this racial modifier to 
their wild empathy checks. 
Woodcraft (Ex) A dryad has a +6 racial bonus to Craft checks 
involving wood, and is always treated as if she had masterwork 
artisan’s woodworking tools when making such checks.
Dryads are tree-fey who prefer secluded woodlands far 
from humanoids in need of lumber. Dryads’ main interests 
are their own survival and that of their beloved forests, and 
they have been known to magically coerce passersby into 
aiding them in tasks they cannot complete. They are more 
likely to be friendly to non-evil druids and rangers, as they 
recognize a mutual respect for or empathy with nature.
Dryads are benign guardians of trees, and though they 
can do little in the way of direct violence, they can trap and 
disable threats to their homes or turn enemies into allies. 
Some keep one or more charmed humanoids in their 
territory to fend off or lead away attackers. Incapacitated 
foes are typically dragged to the edge of the forest by the 
dryad’s allies and left there, but evil or overtly hostile ones 
are killed once combat is over.

Cousins to dwarves, duergar are foul-tempered creatures 
that loathe intruders to their underground realms—but not 
nearly as much as they do their kinfolk closer to the surface.
Duergar dwell in communities deep underground, and 
appear as darker, more twisted versions of their kinder 
kin. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust 
or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows 
them to blend with their underground surroundings. They 
are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven prisoners are 
usually put to backbreaking work, dwarven prisoners are 
generally slain on the spot.
In combat, duergar fire crossbows from a distance, 
then shift to the warhammer after a few rounds. If 

This bald, long-bearded dwarf has dull gray skin, low arching 
brows, and eyes that seem to absorb rather than ref lect the light.

racial traits.
+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, –4 Charisma: Duergar are 
hearty and observant, but also stubborn and belligerent.
Slow and Steady: Duergar have a base speed of 20 feet, but 
their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance.
Darkvision: Duergar can see in the dark up to 120 feet.
Duergar Immunities: Duergar are immune to paralysis, 
phantasms, and poison. They also gain a +2 racial bonus 
on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities.
Stability: Duergar receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD 
against bull rush or trip attempts while on solid ground.
Spell-Like Abilities: Duergar can cast enlarge person and 
invisibility each once per day, using their character level as 
their caster level. Both of these spell-like abilities affect 
the duergar only.
Light Sensitivity: Duergar are dazzled as long as they 
remain in an area of bright light.

Among the most majestic of raptors, these predatory 
birds pluck fish from streams and lakes, drop down on 
rodents and small mammals in alpine meadows, and 
have even been known to pull young mountain goats 
from the assumed safety of their cliffs.
These creatures, like all birds of prey, have 
powerful clawed talons and sharp, hooked beaks 
perfect for tearing f lesh. Their enhanced 
eyesight allows them to spot prey from great 
distances, and they typically hunt in wide 
circling patterns high above the ground.
Eagles typically build their massive nests 
in the tops of tall trees or among the 
rocky crags of steep cliffs. 
During breeding season, 
an eagle lays two eggs, but 
only one chick normally survives, 
as the stronger of the two usually 
kills and eats the weaker.
Eagles generally 
weigh between 8 
and 15 pounds, 
with a wingspan 
of up to 7 feet, 
depending on the 
species.

Air elementals are fast, flying creatures made of living air. 
Primitive and territorial, they resent being summoned or 
doing the bidding of mortals, and much prefer to spend 
their time on the Plane of Air, swooping and racing 
through the endless skies.
Although all air elementals of a similar size have identical 
statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary 
wildly between individuals. One might be an animated 
vortex of wind and smoke, while another might be a smoky 
bird-like creature with glowing eyes and wind for wings.

An air elemental prefers to attack f lying or otherwise 
airbone targets, not only because its mastery over f light 
gives it a slight advantage, but also because it detests the 
thought of having to touch the ground. An air elemental 
can move underwater, and although it is an elemental 
and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in 
Swim and loses much of its speed and mobility when 
underwater.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Earth glide (Ex) A burrowing earth elemental can pass through 
stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as 
easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire 
damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves 
behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or 
other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area 
containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental 
back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it 
succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack 
and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. 
If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a 
–4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply 
to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is 
initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers 
are not included in the statistics block.)

Earth elementals are plodding, stubborn creatures made 
of living stone or earth. When utterly still, they resemble 
a heap of stone or a small hill.
When an earth elemental lumbers into action, its 
actual appearance can vary, although its statistics remain 
identical to other elementals of its size. Most earth 
elementals look like terrestrial animals made out of rock, 
earth, or even crystal, with glowing gemstones for eyes. 
Larger earth elementals often have a stony humanoid 
appearance. Bits of vegetation frequently grow in the soil 
that makes up parts of an earth elemental’s body.

Fire elementals are quick, cruel creatures of living f lame. 
They enjoy frightening beings weaker than themselves, 
and terrorizing any creature they can set on fire.
A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other 
nonf lammable liquid. A body of water is an impassible 
barrier unless the fire elemental can step or jump over it 
or the water is covered with a f lammable material (such 
as a layer of oil).
Fire elementals vary in appearance—they usually 
manifest as coiling serpentine forms made of smoke and 

f lame, but some fire elementals take on shapes more 
akin to humans, demons, or other monsters in order to 
increase the terror of their sudden appearance. Features 
on a fire elemental’s body are made by darker bits of f lame 
or patches of semi-stable smoke, ash, and cinders.

Drench (Ex) The elemental’s touch puts out nonmagical flames 
of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire 
it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental’s HD).
Vortex (Su) A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a 
standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to 
the whirlwind special attack (see page 306), but can only 
form underwater and cannot leave the water.
Water Mastery (Ex) A water elemental gains a +1 bonus 
on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent 
are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental is 
touching the ground, the elemental takes a –4 penalty on 
attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush 
and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating 
or resisting these kinds of attacks.

Water elementals are patient, relentless creatures made 
of living fresh or salt water. They prefer to hide or drag 
their opponents into the water to gain an advantage.
As with other elementals, all water elementals have 
their own unique shapes and appearances. Most appear 
as wave-like creatures with vaguely humanoid faces and 
smaller wave “arms” to either side. Another common 
form is that of any aquatic creature, such as a shark or 
octopus, but made entirely out of water.

These large land animals, majestically wandering the 
plains in tightly knit family herds, are symbols 
of wisdom and strength. Having few natural 
predators, elephants are sometimes 
hunted for their ivory tusks. These 
tusks often become jewelry, 
statuettes, and trinkets

The great mastodons are primeval cousins of 
elephants. Their large tusks dwarf those of 
regular elephants, 
jutting outward and 
then curving back 
toward one another 
at the tips. Shaggy 
woolly mammoths 
are a mastodon 
variant adapted to 
cold environments, but

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 15; 
frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d2 
Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC 
is Constitution based.
Spider Empathy (Ex) This ability functions 
as the druid’s wild empathy, save that an 
ettercap can only use this ability on spiders. An 
ettercap gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Spiders 
are mindless, but this empathic communication imparts 
on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing 
ettercaps to train giant spiders and use them as guardians.
Traps (Ex) The ettercap is particularly skilled at crafting 
cunning traps with its webs. Deadfalls, nooses, and spear 
traps are the most common traps ettercaps build with 
their webs. An ettercap doesn’t require gold to build its 
traps, merely time. Rules for crafting traps can be found in 
Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.
Ettercap Deadfall: CR 3; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; 
Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +10 
melee (4d6), multiple targets (all targets in a 10-ft. square).
Ettercap noose: CR 1; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20; 
Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; 

This hideous purple creature walks upright like a man, but its face 
is that of a spider, and its hands are sickle-shaped claws.

Effect +15 CMB check (grapple).
Ettercap Spear Trap: CR 2; Type mechanical; Perception DC 
20; Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; 
Effect +15 melee (1d6+6).
Ettercaps are typically 6 feet tall and weigh about 200 
pounds. They are solitary creatures and rarely group 
with others of their kind, even to mate. When they do 
group, they tend to attract a variety of different spiders, 
forming a strange collective of ettercaps and arachnids. 
Ettercaps are known for building cunning traps out of 
webs and other natural materials, using them to trap prey. 
They build shelters out of webbing, often high up in the 
trees away from other ground-based predators, and use 
monstrous spiders as lookouts and guardians.
Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their traps often 
ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an 
ettercap does engage its enemies, it attacks with its claws 
and venomous bite. It usually refuses to come within 
melee reach of any foe that is still able to move, and f lees 
if an opponent gets free.

Treasure standard (leather armor, 2 flails, 4 javelins, other treasure)
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Superior Two-Weapon fighting (Ex) An ettin fights with a 
flail or javelin in each hand. Because each of its two heads 
controls an arm, the ettin does not take a penalty on attack 
or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.
Ettins, or two-headed giants, are vicious and unpredictable 
hunters that stalk the night. Their two heads provide them 
with unparalleled powers of perception, making them 
excellent guards.
Ettins superficially resemble hill or stone giants, 
although their tusked facial features betray orc blood in 
their lineage. They have pinkish-brown skin, but ettins 
never bathe if they can help it, which usually leaves them 
so grimy and dirty their skin resembles thick, gray 
hide. Adult ettins are about 13 feet tall and weigh 5,200 
pounds. They live about 75 years.
Ettins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin 
of Giant, Goblin, and Orc. Creatures that can speak any 

of these languages must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence 
check to communicate with an ettin. Check once for each 
bit of information: if the other creature speaks two of these 
languages, the DC is 10, and for someone who speaks all 
three, the DC is 5. 
Though ettins aren’t very intelligent, they are cunning 
fighters. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than 
charge into a fight, but once the battle has started, an ettin 
fights furiously until all enemies are dead.
Ettins lead solitary lives, establishing lairs in secluded 
rocky caves and hollows, often surrounded by pits and 
trenches. Ettins sometimes keep cave bears as pets and 
guardians for their lairs.
A particularly powerful ettin may attract a gang of a few 
followers, possibly with several goblin or orc allies. Such 
gatherings are the exception rather than the rule, however, 
and seldom last long, with individual ettins going their 
separate ways when opportunities for pillage and plunder 
decrease or if the leader is killed.
Mated couples usually come 
together to breed for only a short 
time before going off on their 
own again. Young ettins 
mature quickly, reaching 
adult size within a year, 
when they are kicked 
out to fend for 
themselves.

This lumbering, filthy, two-headed giant wears tattered remnants 
of leather armor and clutches a large f lail in each fist.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Engulf (Ex) If a giant flytrap begins its turn 
with an opponent at least two size categories 
smaller than itself grappled in one of its 
mouths, it can close its jaws completely 
around the foe by making a new combat 
maneuver check (as though attempting 
to pin the foe). If it succeeds, it engulfs 
the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage 
and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity 
floods with digestive enzymes. 
The seal formed is airtight, so 
an engulfed creature risks 
suffocation. Engulf is a 
special form of pinning, 
and an engulfed 
creature can 
escape in the 

same way as he can from being pinned, but since an 
engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant’s 
jaws, the flytrap’s victim cannot be targeted by effects or 
attacks that require line of sight or line of effect. A giant 
flytrap that is grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other 
targets with that bite, but is not otherwise hindered.
A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but 
abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an 
immense version of its more common (and much smaller) 
kin. Whereas the smaller f lytraps supplement their 
growth by catching insects, the giant f lytrap does the 
same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish 
enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant 
names like “mancatcher,” “snapperjaw plant,” “dragonleaf 
plant,” “cowbiter,” and “green gulper,” but adventurers 
know it simply as the giant f lytrap.
As the giant f lytrap’s prey are generally much smarter 
than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much 
more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It 
can lumber slowly along the ground, using its 
writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to 
more populous hunting grounds, and is quite 
canny at blending in with the surrounding 
foliage. A giant f lytrap’s jaws and stalks are 
swift-moving—it reaches out and snaps at 
passersby with lightning speed. The 
plant itself even has a modicum 
of intelligence, and is capable of 
limited tactical choices, such as 
knowing when to break off an 
attack against a powerful foe.
While most giant f lytraps have 
four sets of jaws, some can have 
as few as one, and others eight or more. 
As a general rule, you should increase a giant 
f lytrap’s HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for 
each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its 
CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and 
HD in this manner. If you increase the plant 
by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus by 
more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), 
consult Table 1–1 on page 291 
to make sure that the plant’s 
CR remains appropriate.
A giant f lytrap’s stalks are 
20 feet long, but generally 
sprawl relatively close to the 
central mass—a set of full-grown 
f lytrap jaws is 7 feet 
across. A giant 
f lytrap weighs 
9,000 pounds.

This towering plant is a mass of vines and barbs. Several stalks 
are horribly mobile, each ending in a set of green, toothy jaws.

Poisonous frogs are a bright green color, with additional 
bright yellow, red, or blue markings. They are just over a 
foot long and weigh 10 pounds. The poison of poisonous 
frogs is often gathered by primitive tribes and 
used to coat darts and arrows for hunting.
You can make a larger poison frog either 
by applying the giant simple template or 
by giving a normal giant frog a poison 
frog’s venomous bite.

This creature looks like a normal frog, with moist, mottled, 
blackish-green skin, but grown to truly monstrous size.

This small frog is bright green and red, with electric-blue stripes 
on its hind legs.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
All-Around Vision (Ex) A 
froghemoth’s stalked eyes 
allow it to see in all directions 
at once. It cannot be flanked.
Slowed by Electricity (Ex) 
Although a froghemoth is 
immune to damage 
from electricity, 
whenever 
it would 
otherwise 
take such 
damage it is 
instead slowed for 1 
round.

This immense, three-eyed frog-like creature rears up on powerful 
hind legs. In place of arms, four huge tentacles thrash and writhe.

Thankfully rare, the froghemoth is one of the deep 
swampland’s most ferocious and monstrous predators. 
Capable of catching and eating dinosaurs and even 
dragons, the froghemoth is a frighteningly effective 
ambush hunter. When lying in wait for prey, the 
immense creature secrets itself in deep marsh pools and 
mud so that only the top of its eyestalk emerges from 
the surface. The froghemoth’s eyes are incredibly keen, 
but even more impressive is the monster’s tongue. Like 
a snake, a froghemoth can “taste” its surroundings with 
extraordinary accuracy.
Scholars have long debated the origin of this strangely 
immense predator, arguing that its unusual senses, 
physiology, and resistances make it something more than 
an animal. Druids and other servants of the natural world 
agree—the froghemoth may act like an animal, but it never 
seems fully “comfortable” in its environs. Perpetually ill-
tempered, a froghemoth often seems to kill simply for the 
sake of killing—vomiting up partially digested meals in 
favor of new prey when it encounters such. It’s not unheard 
of to find these strange creatures far from their normal 
habitations, as if the marsh didn’t agree with them and 
sent them wandering in search of a new home. Some sages 
argue that the froghemoth isn’t from this world at all, and 
that these wanderings are instinctual urges to seek out its 
true home—a home not represented by the strange world 
in which the beast finds itself trapped.
A froghemoth is 22 feet tall at the shoulder and 
weighs 16,000 pounds.

freeze (Ex) A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to 
be a statue. A gargoyle that uses freeze can take 
20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a 
stone statue.
Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone 
statues, for they can perch indefinitely without 
moving, allowing them to surprise their foes. 
Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive 
behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful. 
Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies 
harvested from fallen foes are just a few examples of the 
types of things a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair 
and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, 
though they sometimes form fearsome groups called 
“wings” for protection and sport. In certain conditions, 
a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, 
but even the most stable alliances with a gargoyle tribe 
can collapse for the smallest of reasons—gargoyles 
are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive. 
Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the 
largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone 
cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight 

Seemingly carved from a dark gray stone, this sinister crouching 
humanoid resembles a horned, winged demon.

by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, 
and other unfortunates at night.
The longer a tribe of gargoyles abides in a region of 
ruins or buildings, the more its members come to resemble 
that region’s architectural styles. The changes a gargoyle’s 
appearance undergoes are slow and subtle, but over the 
course of years, it can shift radically.
One unusual variant of gargoyle dwells not amid 
buildings and ruins but under the waves of the sea. These 
creatures are known as kapoacinths—they have the same 
basic statistics as normal gargoyles, save that they have the 
aquatic subtype and their wings grant them a swim speed 
of 60 feet (but are useless for actual f light). Kapoacinths 
dwell in shallow, coastal regions where they can shamble 
up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They 
are more likely to form wings, as kapoacinths prefer group 
living to a solitary lifestyle.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) A gelatinous cube’s acid does not harm metal or stone.
Engulf (Ex) Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can 
simply engulf Large or smaller creatures in its path as a 
standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a 
round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube merely has to 
move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. 
Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the cube, 
but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those 
who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 
12 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed—on a success, they 
are pushed back or aside (opponent’s choice) as the cube 
moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube’s 
paralysis and acid, gain the pinned condition, are in danger 
of suffocating, and are trapped within its body until they are 
no longer pinned. The save DC is Strength-based.
Paralysis (Ex) A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing 
slime. A target hit by a cube’s melee or engulf attack must 
succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 
rounds. The cube can automatically engulf a paralyzed 
opponent. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Transparent (Ex) Due to its lack of coloration, a gelatinous cube 
is difficult to discern. A DC 15 Perception check is required to 
notice a motionless gelatinous cube. Any creature 
that fails to notice a gelatinous cube and walks 
into it is automatically engulfed.

One of the dungeon’s most unusual and specialized 
predators, gelatinous cubes spend their existence mindlessly 
roaming dungeon halls and dark caverns, swallowing up 
organic material such as plants, refuse, carrion, and even 
living creatures. Materials the cube cannot digest, such as 
metal and stone, can eventually fill up the creature’s mass 
with such detritus, and at times the creature may excrete 
some of this material out of its body. Often the treasure and 
possessions of past victims remain inside the gelatinous 
cube, leaving a ghostly impression of their material remains.
Sages believe these creatures evolved as a specialized 
advancement of gray oozes. Some beings use gelatinous 
cubes as protectors of dungeons and underground 
fortifications, trapping the immense creatures in massive 
metal crates and transporting them through either slave 
power or magic to their final guard posts. They make 
particularly efficient waste disposal mechanisims as 
well—a tribe that can trap a gelatinous cube in a pit 
or other area that it cannot climb out of can use it as a 
midden or even a deadly trap, depending only on the 
ingenuity of the creatures who caught it.
Gelatinous cubes are generally 10 feet to a side and 
weigh upward of 15,000 pounds, though subterranean 
explorers report larger specimens trawling the deepest 
caves and corridors. In locations with plentiful sources 
of food, gelatinous cubes can exist for hundreds of years, 
if not thousands. However, if denied organic material for 
more than 6 months, a gelatinous cube begins shrinking. 
Eventually this stresses its walls and the creature leaks 
rapidly evaporating slimy liquid until its body collapses 
and disappears completely.

Bits of broken weapons, coins, and a partially digested skeleton 
are visible inside this quivering cube of slime.

Among other genies, djinn get along well with jann and 
marids. They are frequently at odds with the shaitans, 
and are sworn enemies of the efreet, despising these fiery 
genies more than any other genie race. So legendary is

The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Plane of

2,000 pounds. 
Efreet have few allies among geniekind. They certainly 
hate djinn, and attack them on sight. They hold an equally 
strong enmity for marids, and view the jann as frail and 
weak. Efreet often work closely with shaitans, yet even 
then alliances are temporary at best.
A small percentage of efreet are noble. Noble efreet,

Change Size (Sp) Twice per day, a janni can magically change

This regal figure looks like a tall, well-proportioned human, save 
that its eyes sparkle with strange light.

or reduce person spell (the janni chooses when using the 
ability), except that the ability can work on the efreeti. A 
DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is 
Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
Elemental Endurance (Ex) Jann can remain on the Planes of 
Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours at a time. Failure 
to return to the Material Plane before that time expires 
causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour 
spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the 
Material Plane.
The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. 
Jann are formed out of all four elements and must 
therefore spend most of their time on the Material 
Plane. Some lore even casts the janni as the most 
“human” of the genie races, although most jann 
are quick to correct this insult, usually with 
the edge of a sword. A janni is human-sized, 
standing about 6 feet tall and weighing 
about 180 pounds.
Jann are physically strong and 
courageous, and do not take kindly 
to insult or injury. Most are quite 
prone to seeing insult even when 
none is intended by the speaker. If 
overwhelmed in battle, they 
escape using f light and 
invisibility, returning later 
with reinforcements.
Jann enjoy their privacy, 
preferring the solitude of the deep 
desert and isolated oases. They are 
usually suspicious of humans, but 
are often willing to give them the 
benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong 
cultural tradition of hospitality, and 
will never turn away someone in need of 
food, water, or shelter, though they might 
expect payment in the form of a favor at 
some later date. 
Among the other genie races, jann 
generally have good relations with both 
djinn and shaitans. While not actively 
enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof 
marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the 
efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript 
them into their armies.
A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble 
jann, often called sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit 
Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the 
following spell-like abilities: 3/day—augury, detect 
magic, and divination. A noble janni’s caster level for its 
spell-like abilities is 12th. Noble jann are CR 7. 141

Water Mastery (Ex) A marid gains a +1 bonus on attack and 
damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. 
If the opponent or the marid is touching the ground, the 
marid takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
Water’s fury (Su) As a standard action, a marid can release 
a jet of water in a 60-foot line that deals 1d6 points of 
damage and blinds the target struck for 1d6 rounds. A DC 
18 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the 
blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Vortex (Su) A marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, 
churning water once every 10 mintues. This ability 
functions identically to the whirlwind ability 
(see page 306 for full 
details on this special 
attack), save that it can 
only be used while the 
marid is underwater; a 
marid cannot leave a body 
of water while in vortex form.
Marids are genies from the 
Plane of Water. The most 
powerful of all the genie 
races, they are said to possess 
the strength of the ocean’s currents 
and teeth made of pearl. A marid 
stands about 16 feet 
tall and weighs nearly 
2,500 pounds.
The marids are perhaps 
the most unpredictable 
and capricious of the genies, 
a quality that the others 
(particularly shaitans) find 
to be both aggravating and 
embarrassing to the entire 
genie culture. Many marids 
become dancers, storytellers, 
performers, or other types of artists, and 
often travel to the Material Plane in disguise 
to seek out new audiences.
A small percentage of marids can lay claim to 
nobility. Noble marids, often called shahzadas, 
have 14 Hit Dice and gain the following spell-like 
abilities: 3/day—cone of cold, ice storm; 1/day—elemental 
swarm (water elementals only), permanent image. A noble 
marid’s caster level for its spell-like abilities is 20th. 
Noble marids are CR 11.

Metalmorph (Su) As a standard action, a shaitan may touch 
a single metal object of no more than 10 pounds and 
transform it into any other metal for 1 day. 
Stone Curse (Su) If a shaitan wins a bull rush check by 5 or 
more and pushes its target into a stone barrier, the target 
must make a DC 19 Reflex save or be forced into the barrier 
as if the target had cast meld into stone until the victim 
makes a successful DC 19 Fortitude save as a full-round 
action to exit the stone. The save DCs are Strength-based.
Stone glide (Su) This functions as the earth elemental’s earth 
glide ability, except the shaitan can move through stone, 
dirt, crystal, or metal.
Shaitans are boastful and proud genies from the Plane of 
Earth with f lesh of metal, gems, or stone. A shaitan stands 
about 11 feet tall and weighs roughly 5,000 pounds.
Some shaitans are noble. Often called pashas, they 
have 18 Hit Dice and gain the spell-like 
ability earthquake, usable once per day, as

When a soul is not allowed to rest due to some great 
injustice, either real or perceived, it sometimes comes back 
as a ghost. Such beings are in eternal anguish, lacking in 
substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts 
can be any alignment, the majority cling to the living 
world out of a powerful sense of rage and hatred, and as a 
result are chaotic evil—even the ghost of a good or lawful 
creature can become hateful and cruel in its afterlife.
More than most of the monsters in this book, a ghost 
benefits from a strong and detailed backstory. Why did 
this character become a ghost? What are the legends 
surrounding the ghost? An encounter with a ghost should 
never happen completely out of the blue—there are plenty 
of other incorporeal undead like wraiths and spectres to 
fill that role. A proper encounter with a ghost should be a 
climactic scene after a lengthy period of tension building 
with lesser minions or manifestations of the undead spirit. 
The sample ghost above is that of a human princess who 
was murdered by an unfaithful lover—after she confronted 

him, he murdered her by wrapping her in chains and 
throwing her into the castle well, where she drowned. The 
ghost’s abilities were selected to fit this backstory, and it 
shows how potent a villain you can create with a simple 
NPC class. Applying the template to creatures with class 
levels or creatures with significant racial abilities can 
create even more powerful ghosts.
When a ghost is created, it retains incorporeal “copies” 
of any items that it particularly valued in life (provided 
the originals are not in another creature’s possession). 
The equipment works normally for the ghost but passes 
harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A 
weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can 
harm material creatures, but any such attack deals only 
half as much damage (50%) unless it is a ghost touch weapon. 
A ghost can use shields or armor only if they have the ghost 
touch quality.
The original items remain behind, just as the ghost’s 
physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, 
the incorporeal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers 
the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its 
original resting place (and thus regain the item’s use).
Creating a Ghost
“Ghost” is an acquired template that can be added to any 
living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 6. A 
ghost retains all the base creature’s statistics and special 
abilities except as noted here.
Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.
Type: The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not 
recalculate the creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill 
points. It gains the incorporeal subtype.
Armor Class: A ghost gains a def lection bonus equal to 
its Charisma modifier. It loses the base creature’s natural 
armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses not 
from force effects or ghost touch items.
Hit Dice: Change all of the creature’s racial Hit Dice 
to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain 
unchanged. Ghosts use their Charisma modifiers to 
determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).
Defensive Abilities: A ghost retains all of the defensive 
abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a 
corporeal form to function. Ghosts gain channel resistance 
+4, darkvision 60 ft., the incorporeal ability, and all of the 
immunities granted by its undead traits. Ghosts also gain 
the rejuvenation ability.
Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, it’s difficult to destroy 
a ghost through simple combat: the “destroyed” spirit 
restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells 
are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to 
permanently destroy a ghost is to determine the reason 
for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from 
resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit 

144

144

GGhhoosstt

and may require a good deal of research, and should be 
created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.
Speed: Ghosts lose their previous speeds and gain a f ly 
speed of 30 feet (perfect), unless the base creature has a 
higher f ly speed.
Melee and Ranged Attacks: A ghost loses all of the base 
creature’s attacks. If it could wield weapons in life, it can 
wield ghost touch weapons as a ghost. 
Special Attacks: A ghost retains all the special attacks of 
the base creature, but any relying on physical contact do not 
function. In addition, a ghost gains one ghost special attack 
from the list below for every 3 points of CR (minimum 
1—the first ability chosen must always be corrupting 
touch). The save DC against a ghost’s special attack is equal 
to 10 + 1/2 ghost’s HD + ghost’s Charisma modifier unless 
otherwise noted. Additional ghost abilities beyond these 
can be designed at the GM’s discretion.
Corrupting Gaze (Su): The ghost is disfigured through age 
or violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet 
that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage 
(Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not 
physical damage).
Corrupting Touch (Su): All ghosts gain this 
incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of 
its incorporeal body through a foe’s body as a 
standard action, the ghost inf licts a number of 
d6s equal to its CR in damage. This damage is 
not negative energy—it manifests in the form of 
physical wounds and aches from supernatural 
aging. Creatures immune to magical aging 
are immune to this damage, but otherwise the 
damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. 
A Fortitude save halves the damage inf licted.
Draining Touch (Su): The ghost died while insane 
or diseased. It gains a touch attack that drains 1d4 
points from any one ability score it selects on a hit. 
On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 
points of damage to itself. When a ghost makes a 
draining touch attack, it cannot use its standard 
ghostly touch attack.
Frightful Moan (Su): The ghost died in the throes of 
crippling terror. It can emit a frightful moan as a standard 
action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must 
succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. 
This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that 
successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by 
the same ghost’s moan for 24 hours.
Malevolence (Su): The ghost’s jealousy of the living 
is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can 
merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. 
This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 
10th or the ghost’s Hit Dice, whichever is higher), 
except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this 

ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target 
can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature 
that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost’s 
malevolence for 24 hours.
Telekinesis (Su): The ghost’s death involved great physical 
trauma. The ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action 
once every 1d4 rounds (caster level 12th or equal to the 
ghost’s HD, whichever is higher).
Abilities: Cha +4; as an incorporeal undead creature, a 
ghost has no Strength or Constitution score.
Skills: Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Perception and 
Stealth skill checks. A ghost always treats Climb, Disguise, 
Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), 
Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class 
skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.

1 day; frequency 1 day; effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; 
cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. 
A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the 
next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this 
way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not 
under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for 
the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all 
respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast.
Ghouls are undead that haunt graveyards and eat corpses. 
Legends hold that the first ghouls were either cannibalistic 
humans whose unnatural hunger dragged them back 
from death or humans who in life fed on the rotting 
remains of their kin and died (and were reborn) 
from the foul disease—the true source of these 
undead scavengers is unclear.
Ghouls lurk on the edges of civilization (in 
or near cemeteries or in city sewers) where 
they can find ample supplies of their favorite 
food. Though they prefer rotting bodies and 
often bury their victims for a while to improve their

taste, they eat fresh kills if they are hungry enough. 
Though most surface ghouls live primitively, rumors 
speak of ghoul cities deep underground led by priests 
who worship ancient cruel gods or strange demon lords 
of hunger. These “civilized” ghouls are no less horrific 
in their eating habits, and in fact the concept of a well-
laid ghoul banquet table is perhaps even more horrifying 
than the concept of taking a meal fresh from the coffin.
Ghast
Ghasts are ghouls with the advanced monster template. A 
ghast’s paralysis even affects elves. Ghasts roam in packs 
of their own kind or lead groups of common ghouls. The 
stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures 
is overwhelming, granting them the stench extraordinary 
ability (10-foot radius, Fort DC 15 negates, sickened for 
1d6+4 minutes).
Lacedon
These aquatic cousins of the ghoul lurk near hidden reefs 
or other places where ships are likely to meet their ends. 
Lacedons have a base land speed of 30 feet and a 
swim speed of 30 feet.

wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one 
or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). 
Cloud giants have an unusually wide alignment spread—
approximately half are good and half are evil. Good cloud 
giants build roads from their settlements to connect 
with other humanoid roads in order to foster trade. It’s 
not uncommon to see a good cloud giant walking among 
humans, for example, in a human city near a tall mountain 
range. Evil cloud giants tend not to bother with permanent 
settlements and instead live on high peaks in crude 
shelters, only coming down to raid villages for whatever 
they might need. These two philosophies often see violent 
and long-lasting wars erupt between neighboring tribes.
Legends abound of magical cloud giant cities nestled 
in the very clouds themselves that float with the winds 
and circumnavigate the world. While most cloud giants 
recognize this as a fantasy, there are some who not only 
claim to have seen them but have dedicated the 
entirety of their long lives to finding them again.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
heated Rock (Su) Fire giants transfer the heat of their bodies to 
rocks as part of an attack action when they throw rocks. A 
heated rock deals 1d6 points of additional fire damage on a hit.
Fire giants are the most rigid and militaristic of all the 
giant races. They constantly train for war and practice 
brutal tactics on anyone and everyone that gets in their 
way. Their rigid command structure is complete with 
soldiers, officers, and even generals, and they obey orders 
from their kings unquestioningly.
Fire giants have bright orange hair that f lickers and 
glows almost as if it were af lame. An adult male is 12 to 

16 feet tall, has a chest that measures 9 feet around, and 
weighs about 7,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter 
and lighter. Fire giants can live to be 350 years old.
Fire giants wear sturdy cloth or leather garments 
colored red, orange, yellow, or black. Warriors wear 
helmets and half-plate armor of blackened steel and 
wield large greatswords that they use to cut swaths 
across the battlefield. In large groups, fire giants fight 
with brutal and efficient group tactics, and aren’t afraid 
to sacrifice one or two of their members to draw an 
enemy into an ambush.
Fire giants prefer hot locations—the hotter, the better. 
They’ve been found in deserts, volcanoes, hot springs, 
and deep beneath the earth near lava vents. They live 
in castles, walled settlements, or large caverns, and the 
design of these locations ref lects their rigid, militaristic 
lifestyle, with officers living in better quarters than the 
rank-and-file.

This lumbering giant has short stumpy legs and powerful, 
muscular arms. Its hair and beard seem to be made of fire.

Treasure standard (chain shirt, greataxe, other treasure)
A frost giant’s hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, 
and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants 

dress in skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own. 
Frost giant warriors also don chain shirts and metal helmets 
decorated with horns or feathers. An adult male stands about 
15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds. Females 
are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to 
males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old. 
Frost giants are among the most feared giants, as their 
wanton destruction, battle lust, and fearless demeanor 
push them to ever-increasing displays of brutality. Frost 
giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks 
until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, 
then wading in with their enormous greataxes. A favorite 
tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow 
at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents 
will have difficulty reaching them, and then starting an 
avalanche before leaping into battle. Frost giants can 
hide well in snowy environments and are masters of 
stealth in their domain.
Frost giants survive on hunting and raiding alone, 
as they live in desolate, frigid environments. Frost 
giant groups are split almost evenly between those that 
live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles 
and those that roam the frozen north as nomads 
in search of spoils and provisions. Frost 
giant leaders call themselves jarls 
and demand absolute obedience 
from their followers. At any 
time a jarl may be challenged 
by combat for leadership of the 
tribe. These challenges 
typically result in the 
death of one of the 
combatants. A single jarl 
can often count a 
dozen or more 
smaller frost 
giant tribes 
as part of his 
extended tribe. In 
such a situation, 
the leaders of the lesser 
tribes are known simply as 
chieftains or warlords.
Frost giants love to take 
captives, and use them for food 
as well as slaves and commodities. 
Every group of frost giants typically has 1–2 
humanoid slaves shackled to a slave handler—
usually the meanest and cruelest non-jarl in the 
group. They are also quite fond of monstrous pets—
white dragons and winter wolves are popular choices, 
but remorhazes, yetis, and even linnorms can be found 
dwelling in a frost giant lair.

This giant looks like a thick, muscular human. It has frost-white 
skin and long, light blue hair that it wears braided.

Treasure standard (hide armor, greatclub, other treasure)
Skin color among hill giants ranges from light tan to deep, 
ruddy brown. Their hair is brown or black, with eyes the 
same color. Hill giants wear layers of crudely prepared 
hides with the fur left on. They seldom wash or repair 
their garments, preferring simply to add more hides as 
their old ones wear out. Adults are around 10 feet tall 
and weigh about 1,100 pounds. Hill giants can live 
to be 200 years old, but almost never do.
Hill giants prefer to fight from high, rocky 
outcroppings, where they can pelt opponents with rocks 
and boulders while limiting the risk to themselves. Hill 
giants love to make overrun attacks against smaller 
creatures when they first join battle. Thereafter, they stand 
fast and swing away with their massive clubs. 
Hill giants are the most nomadic of all the humanoid 
giant species, preferring to travel from one settlement to 

the next in order to raid and pillage. While they prefer 
temperate climates, they’ll travel far from their preferred 
environment so long as the raiding is plentiful and 
successful. They are, as a whole, incredibly selfish creatures 
and rarely engage in battles they don’t automatically 
know they’ll win. Hill giants are known for shoving one 
another at terrifying foes and won’t hesitate to sacrifice 
a clanmate to save their own skins. Roving bands of hill 
giants are common in temperate hills, and their constant 
aggression makes them one of the more feared dangers in 
this climate.
Solitary, non-evil hill giants are very rare but can 
sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, though 
they are almost never accepted in central cities or population 
centers. They do best as laborers and soldiers in outlying 
frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to 
negotiate with marauding hill giant bands. Unfortunately, 
hill giants who shed their racial lifestyle for civilization are 
mocked and often killed on sight by their nomadic 
brethren. Still, these “civilized” hill giants can 
find their place within society and many have 
managed to live peaceful, uneventful lives.

This hunched giant exudes power and a crude, stupid anger, its 
filthy fur clothing bespeaking a brutish and backwoods lifestyle.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Improved Rock Catching (Ex) A stone giant gains a +4 racial 
bonus on its Reflex save when attempting to catch a 
thrown rock with rock catching. This ability otherwise 
works like the rock catching ability (see page 303).
Stone giants prefer thick leather garments, dyed 
in shades of brown and gray to match the stone around 
them. Adults are about 12 feet tall, weigh about 1,500 
pounds, and can live to be 800 years old.
Stone giants fight from a distance whenever possible, 
but if they can’t avoid melee, they favor gigantic clubs 
chiseled out of stone. A favorite tactic of stone giants 
is to stand nearly motionless, blending in with the 
background, then move forward to throw rocks and 
surprise their foes.
Stone giants prefer living in enormous caves in high-
altitude, rocky peaks. They rarely live more than a few 
days’ travel from other bands of stone giants, and even 

raise shared herds of goats and other livestock between 
tribes. Older stone giants tend to wander away from the 
tribe for a significant period of time in their later years, 
either living in seclusion somewhere or attempting to 
merge into other humanoid civilizations. After decades 
of this self-imposed exile, those who return do so as 
stone giant elders.
Stone Giant Elders
Some stone giants develop special abilities related to 
their environment. Called elders, these stone giants have 
Charisma scores of at least 15 and three spell-like abilities 
(CL 10th). Once per day they can use stone shape, stone tell, 
and either transmute rock to mud or transmute mud to rock 
(DC 17). The save DC is Charisma-based. One in 10 elders 
is a sorcerer, usually of 3rd to 6th level. Stone giant elders 
add +1 to their CR.

This giant has chiseled, muscular features and a f lat, forward-
sloping head, looking almost as if it were carved of stone.

with bronze skin, dark hair, and sparkling green eyes.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Militant (Ex) Storm giants are proficient with all simple and all 
martial weapons.
Water Breathing (Ex) Storm giants can breathe water as well 
as air.
Storm giants tend toward tanned complexions, though 
some rare specimens have violet skin, deep violet or 
blue-black hair, and silvery gray or purple eyes. Such 
violet coloration is considered to be good luck among 
storm giants, and those possessing it tend to become 
leaders among their kind. Adults are typically 21 feet 
tall and weigh 12,000 pounds. Storm giants can live to 
be 600 years old. When at rest, they prefer to wear short, 
loose tunics belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and 
headbands. They wear a few pieces of simple but finely 
crafted jewelry, with anklets (favored by barefoot 
giants), rings, or circlets being most common. Yet 
when they outfit themselves for battle, they don 
shimmering breastplates and 
wield enormous greatswords 
and bows.
Storm giants tend to be 
reclusive, prefering to dwell 
along remote coastlines or 
on tropical islands. Yet 
like their namesakes, 
they are prone to violent 
mood swings. Storm 
giants are quick to anger 
in the face of evil and can be 
brutal, dangerous foes when 
insulted. In battle, they prefer 
to send a hail of arrows to 
rain down on their foes, only 
drawing their greatswords 
after opponents get inside 
their bow range.
Storm giants live in well-
constructed towers, castles, 
or walled settlements, and 
prefer to live off the land. 
They maintain enormous, 
well-tended gardens and 
manage hundreds of acres 
of farmland per group. They 
often hire other humanoids, 
such as elves or humans, to 
help them run their massive 
farms. A storm giant enclave 
often takes responsibility for 
the safety of an entire island or 
stretch of coastline.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
All-Around Vision (Ex) A gibbering mouther sees in all 
directions at once. It cannot be flanked.
Amorphous (Ex) A gibbering mouther’s body is malleable and 
shapeless. It is immune to precision damage (like sneak 
attacks) and critical hits, and can move through an area as 
small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-
eighth its space when squeezing.
Blood Drain (Ex) On a successful grapple check after grabbing, 
several of the creature’s mouths attach to its target. Each 
round it maintains its grapple, its mouths automatically 
deal 1d4 points of bite damage and 1 point of 
Constitution damage as it drains its victim’s blood.
Engulf (Ex) This ability functions as swallow whole, 
except for the following changes. An engulfed creature 
is trapped in the gibbering mouther’s body, where 
several of its mouths continue to feed and drain 
blood. A gibbering mouther can engulf only one foe 
of its size or smaller at a time. If an engulfed creature 
cuts its way free (the mouther’s damage reduction 
still applies to those inside), the mouther simply flows 
together again and can still use its engulf attack.

This horrid mass of eyes, mouths, and formless f lesh stares in 
all directions, its countless maws yammering ceaselessly.

GGiiaant, Storm–Gibbering Mouther

nt, Storm–Gibbering Mouther

gibbering (Su) As a free action, a gibbering mouther can emit 
a cacophony of maddening sound. All creatures other than 
gibbering mouthers within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 
13 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-
affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves 
cannot be affected by the same mouther’s gibbering for 24 
hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
ground Manipulation (Su) At will as a standard action, a 
gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth under its 
body to grow soft and muddy. The ground remains muddy 
for 1 minute after the mouther moves off of the location. 
A gibbering mouther can move through these areas with 
ease, but other creatures treat them as difficult terrain.
Spittle (Ex) Each round as a free action, a gibbering mouther 
can emit a stream of acidic spittle at one target within 30 
feet. On a successful attack, the target is blinded for 1d4 
rounds unless he succeeds on a DC 18 Fortitude save. The 
save DC is Constitution-based.
Disgusting, loathsome, and hungry—these are the only 
words that properly describe the gibbering mouther. A 
foul beast that lurks in underground caves, sewers, and 
nightmares, mouthers have no societal, ecological or 
religious significance other than their ability to drive 
those that listen to them mad. Some scholars believe that 
gibbering mouthers are a lesser variant of the much more 
dangerous shoggoth, while others theorize they are a 
punishment by some powerful being or deity inf licted on 
those who have offended it.

Girallons are among the jungle’s most dangerous 
predators. They are aggressive, carnivorous, highly 
territorial, and incredibly strong. Worse, their four 
muscular arms are capable of inflicting incredible damage 
on anything that falls into their clutches. Their exotic 
appearance makes them popular creatures in certain cities 
as attractions in gladiatorial combats, either starved and 
pitted against each other, or set against gladiators eager to 
increase their fame and notoriety. One who kills a girallon 
is all but assured of fame, yet most battles against these 
ferocious beasts end poorly for those foolish enough to 
attempt to single-handedly defeat one. An adult girallon is 
8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white 
fur. It weighs roughly 800 pounds.
Girallons live in troops led by a dominant male. Solitary 
girallons are usually young males looking to start their 
own troop. Girallons are very territorial and tend to attack 
intruders without warning, including strangers of their 
own kind. Groups of girallons may attack in a line to drive 
prey toward a cliff or other hazard, or quietly form a ring 
around their target and suddenly close in.
While most girallons are little more than beasts, 
ancient carvings and the oral traditions of some tribes 

hint that the girallon wasn’t always the stupid creature 
it is today. According to these legends, the first girallons 
were men who called upon savage demon gods to gain 
great strength, yet in so doing abandoned their humanity. 
With each generation, these first girallons grew more and 
more savage and feral, and the same legends maintain 
that these intelligent girallons still dwell in the darkest 
part of the jungle. In addition to their intellects, these 
girallons retain a vast appetite for cruelty. Called “high 
girallons,” these creatures are almost always chaotic evil, 
and have Intelligence scores of 6 or higher. An intelligent 
girallon generally speaks whatever language the local 
humans speak. Often, they become leaders of unusually 
large troops of their less-intelligent kin, inhabit strange 
ruined cities in the jungle or mountains, and conduct 
raids on villages for food and treasure. Some primitive 
tribes worship these girallons as the agents of evil gods 
or demons, and a few high girallons have been known to 
work for or even breed with tribal orcs, inspiring legends 
of four-armed “white orcs.”

This four-armed, gorilla-like creature, covered with matted white 
fur, roars in rage as it rears up to its full, towering height.

Gnolls are a race of hulking, humanoids that resemble 
hyenas in more than mere appearance; they show a 
striking affinity with the scavenging animals, to the 
point of keeping them as pets, and ref lect many of the 
lesser creatures’ behaviors.
Gnolls are capable hunters, but are far happier to 
scavenge or steal a kill than to go out and track down 
prey. This laziness impels them to acquire slaves of 
whatever type is available, whom they force to dig 
warrens, gather supplies and water, and even hunt for 
their gnoll masters.
Creatures other than hyenas and other gnolls are either 
meat or slaves, depending upon the temperament of the 
tribe. Even a dead or fallen comrade is a fresh meal for 
a gnoll, who might honor a distinguished tribe member 
with a brief prayer, or thoroughly cook one that has died of 
a wasting disease, but otherwise view a dead gnoll as little 

Hunched and feral, this furred, hyena-headed humanoid stands 
slightly taller than the average human.

GGiirraalllloonn––GGnnoollll

different from any other creature. The more “civilized” 
gnolls do not eat their prisoners, but instead keep them 
as slaves, either to defend or improve their lair or to trade 
with other tribes or slaver bands.
Gnolls relish combat, but only when they have the 
obvious advantage of numbers. In other situations, they 
prefer to avoid combat except as a means of winning a kill 
from another hunter, or as a clever ambush to bring down 
a large meal. These hyena-men see no value in courage or 
valor, instead preferring to f lee once it becomes clear that 
victory is not possible, noting that it is better to run with 
tail tucked away than to lose one’s tail entirely.
During combat, gnolls use a strange mixture of pack 
tactics and individual standoffs. If a gnoll feels that it is 
winning, it attempts to take down a weaker being rather 
than aiding its fellows. If the gnolls are struggling, they 
gang up on a powerful leader and try to take that creature 
down, in the hopes of forcing its allies to f lee.
Gnoll leaders are typically rangers, although clerics are 
highly regarded as well. Most gnolls find arcane magic 
difficult to master, and as a result it is relatively rare to 
see a gnoll bard, sorcerer, or wizard.

Goblins prefer to dwell in caves, amid large and dense 
thickets of thistles and brambles, or in structures built 
and then abandoned by others. Very few goblins have 
the drive to build structures of their own. Coastlines 
are favored, as goblins are quite fond of sifting through 
junk and f lotsam in an unending quest to find treasures 
among the refuse of more civilized races.
Goblin hatred runs deep, and few things inspire 
their wrath more than gnomes (who have long 
fought against goblins), horses (who frighten goblins 
tremendously), and regular dogs (whom goblins regard as 
pale imitations of goblin dogs).
Goblins are also quite superstitious, and treat magic 
with a fawning mixture of awe and fear. They have the 
habit of ascribing magic to the mundane as well, with 
fire and writing both taking on mystical power in goblin 
society. Fire is much loved by goblins for its capacity to 

wreak great destruction and because it doesn’t require size 
or strength to wield, but written words are hated. Goblins 
believe that writing steals words out of your head, and as a 
result of this belief, goblins are universally illiterate.
Goblins are voracious and can eat their body weight in 
food daily without growing fat. Goblin lairs always have 
numerous storerooms and larders. While they prefer 
human and gnome f lesh, a goblin won’t turn down any 
food—except, perhaps, vegetables.
Goblin Characters
Goblins are defined by their class levels—they do not possess 
racial Hit Dice. All goblins have the following racial traits.
–2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, –2 Charisma: Goblins are 
fast, but weak and unpleasant to be around.
Small: Goblins are Small creatures and gain a +1 size 
bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a –1 
penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on 
Stealth checks.
Fast: Goblins are fast for their size, and have a base 
speed of 30 feet.
Darkvision: Goblins can see in the dark up to 60 feet.
Skilled: +4 racial bonus on Ride and Stealth checks.
Languages: Goblins begin play speaking Goblin. Goblins 
with high Intelligence scores can choose any of these bonus 
languages: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, 
Halfling, Orc.

This creature stands barely three feet tall, its scrawny, humanoid 
body dwarfed by its wide, ungainly head.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Allergic Reaction (Ex) A goblin dog’s dander is highly irritating 
to all creatures save those with the goblinoid subtype. A 
non-goblinoid creature damaged by a goblin dog’s bite, 
who deals damage to a goblin dog with a natural weapon 
or unarmed attack, or who otherwise comes into contact 
with a goblin dog (including attempts to grapple or ride 
the creature) must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or break 
out in an itching rash. A creature affected by this rash takes 
a –2 penalty to Dexterity and Charisma for 1 day (multiple 
allergic reactions do not stack). Remove disease or any 
magical healing removes the rash instantly. This is a disease 
effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Loathed by men and beasts alike, goblin dogs are ugly, 
stinking, craven, and foul-tempered. It’s no surprise that 
goblins find kindred spirits in these shunned, disgusting 
beasts. Constantly itching, aff licted with a species-wide 
mange exacerbated by prolific dander, even the healthiest 
goblin dog looks sickly and starved.
Despite its name, the goblin dog is in fact a species of 
rodent grown monstrously large. Their long-legged shape 
and proclivity to hunt and run in packs earned them their 
popular name, a name that many goblins take issue with, 
as it galls the average goblin to consider these, their favored 
mounts, having anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of 
course, being goblins, they haven’t bothered to come up 

This mangy canine’s face has the same f lat nose, beady eyes, and 
protruding teeth as a rat grown grotesquely large.

with alternate names for goblin dogs. Perhaps they don’t 
realize they can.
Contact with a goblin dog’s infested, mangy hide causes 
most other creatures to break out into hives, a condition 
known as “goblin rash.” Goblinoids seem to be immune 
to this aff liction, and are fond of keeping goblin dogs as 
guardians and mounts.
Despite their skin conditions and disorders, goblin 
dogs are highly resistant to disease. Their favored food 
is carrion—the riper, the better. That many goblin tribes 
let their goblin dogs run free in their lairs is the single 
reason most goblin dens aren’t filthier than they actually 
are; constantly hungry, a goblin dog eats anything it can 
chew that it finds left behind by other, more discerning 
palates.
A goblin dog is 5 feet long but weighs only 75 pounds.

Golem 
Golems are magically created automatons of great 
power. They stand apart from other constructs in the 
nature of their animating force—golems are granted 
their magical life via an elemental spirit, typically that 
of an earth elemental. The process of creating a golem 
binds the spirit to the artificial body, merging it with 
this specially prepared vessel and subjecting it to the 
will of the golem’s creator.
Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from 
their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are 
incapable of complex strategy or tactics. A golem’s creator 
can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see 
and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually 
follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though 
if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the 
golem a simple command to govern its actions in his 
absence, or can order the golem to obey the commands of 
another, but the golem’s creator can always resume control 
by commanding the golem to obey him alone.
Constructing a Golem
The cost to create a golem includes the cost of the physical 
body and all the materials and spell components used in 
its creation. Each golem entry gives specific details on the 
materials required and the total cost for its creation.
Note: The market price of a golem with more Hit Dice than 
the typical golem described in each entry is increased by 
5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die it possesses beyond the 
standard for its kind, and increases by an additional 50,000 
gp if the golem’s size increases. Building a golem with the 
advanced simple template increases its cost by 15,000 gp.
Shield Guardians
A spellcaster with enough talent, resources, and inspiration 
can create a special variant of a golem known as a shield 
guardian. Any true golem can be created as a shield 
guardian, but the choice to do so must be made during the 
golem’s construction—a completed golem cannot later be 
“upgraded” to function as a shield guardian. 
Shield guardians are designed to serve as bodyguards. 
When created, a shield guardian is keyed to a magical 
amulet that is constructed at the same time as (and as part of 
the cost of) the guardian. Henceforth, it regards the wearer 
of that amulet as its master, protecting and following that 
individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not 
to do so). If a shield guardian’s amulet is destroyed, the 
guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If 
the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian 
carries out the last command it was given.
A shield guardian obeys its master’s verbal commands 
to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much 

beyond combat, protection, and simple manual labor. 
It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific 
times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of 
the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, 
and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.
Shield guardians have the same statistics as the base 
golem, but with the following additional special qualities. 
A shield guardian’s CR is equal to the base golem’s CR + 2.
Controlled (Ex) A shield guardian that has the berserk 
special attack cannot go berserk as long as the wearer of 
its amulet is within 30 feet. 
Fast Healing (Ex) A shield guardian has fast healing 5.
Find Master (Su) As long as a shield guardian and its 
amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can 
locate the amulet’s wearer (or just the amulet, if it is 
removed after the guardian is called).
Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves 
to defend the wearer of its amulet. All attacks against the 
amulet wearer take a –2 penalty when the shield guardian 
is adjacent to its master.
Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of a shield guardian’s 
amulet can activate this defensive ability as a standard 
action if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as 
the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the 
shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to 
the amulet wearer (note that this ability does not provide 
the spell’s AC or save bonuses). Damage transferred in 
this manner bypasses any defensive abilities (such as 
immunity or damage reduction) the golem possesses.
Spell Storing (Sp) A shield guardian can store one 
spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another 
creature. It “casts” this spell when commanded to do so 
or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is 
used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the 
same spell again).
Construction: A shield guardian’s base materials cost 
an additional 25,000 gp above the base golem’s cost. The 
creature’s master may assemble the body or hire someone 
else to do the job. The Craft check required to make the 
body is 4 higher than normal for the base golem’s kind. 
The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time—it costs 
20,000 gp above and beyond the shield guardian’s total 
cost. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is 
animated through an extended magical ritual that 
requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, 
similar to an alchemist’s laboratory and costing 500 gp 
to establish. If the creator is personally constructing 
the creature’s body, the building and the ritual can be 
performed together. The creator must have a minimum 
caster level of 2 higher than the base golem’s minimum 
required caster level. In addition, the following spells are 
added to the base golem’s requirements: discern location 
and either shield or shield other.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Berserk (Ex) When a clay golem enters combat, there is a 
cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental spirit 
breaks free and the golem goes berserk. This chance resets 
to 0% after one minute of inactivity. A berserk golem 
attacks the nearest living creature or smashes some object 
smaller than itself if no creature is within reach. Once it 
goes berserk, no known method can reestablish control.
Cursed Wound (Ex) The damage a clay golem deals doesn’t heal 
naturally and resists magical healing. A character attempting 
to use magical healing on a creature damaged by a clay 
golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the 
healing has no effect on the injured creature.
haste (Su) After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a 
clay golem can haste itself once per day as a free action. The 
effect lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A clay golem is immune to any spell 
or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, 
certain spells and effects function differently against the 
creature, as noted below.
•	A	move earth spell drives the golem back 120 feet and deals 
3d12 points of damage to it (no save).
•	A	disintegrate spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 
1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage (no save).
•	An	earthquake spell cast directly at a clay golem stops it 
from moving on its next turn and deals 5d10 points of 

damage (no save).
•	Any	magical	attack	against	a	clay	golem	that	deals	acid	
damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage 
it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause 
the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any 
excess as temporary hit points. A clay golem gets no saving 
throw against magical attacks that deal acid damage.
A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff 
leather garment around its hips. It stands over 8 feet tall 
and weighs 600 pounds.
Construction
A clay golem’s body must be sculpted from a single block of 
clay weighing at least 1,000 pounds, treated with rare oils

Berserk (Ex) When a flesh golem enters 
combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance 
each round that its elemental 
spirit breaks free and the 
golem goes berserk. The 
uncontrolled golem goes on 
a rampage, attacking the nearest 
living creature or smashing some object 
smaller than itself if no creature is within 
reach, then moving on to spread more 
destruction. The golem’s creator, if within 
60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking 
firmly and persuasively to the golem, which 
requires a DC 19 Charisma check. It takes 1 
minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the 
golem’s berserk chance to 0%.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A flesh golem is 
immune to any spell or spell-like ability 
that allows spell resistance. In addition, 
certain spells and effects function 
differently against the creature, 
as noted below.
•	A	magical	attack	that	deals	cold	or	fire	damage	slows	a	flesh	
golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save).
•	A	magical	attack	that	deals	electricity	damage	breaks	any	slow 

effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 
3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the 
amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full 
normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. 
A flesh golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal 
electricity damage.
A f lesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid 
body parts, stitched together into a single composite 
form. Its cadaverous f lesh has a sickly green or yellowish 
tint. A f lesh golem wears whatever clothing its creator 
desires, usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no 
possessions and no weapons. A f lesh golem stands 8 feet 
tall and weighs 500 pounds.
A f lesh golem cannot speak, although it can emit 
a hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff-
jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body.
Although most f lesh golems are mindless, there are 
persistent rumors of unusual golems who somehow 
retain the memories of a previous life. The head (and 
thus brain) of such f lesh golems must be 
just the right combination of 
fresh and (in its previous life) 
strong-willed, and even then luck 
and chance during the golem’s 
creation seem just as important 
in retaining the creature’s mind. 
Certainly most who construct f lesh 
golems prefer mindless slaves 
over free-willed creations, and as 
a result intelligent f lesh golems are 
rare indeed.
Construction
The pieces of a f lesh golem must come 
from normal humanoid corpses that have 
not decayed significantly. Assembly requires 
a minimum of six different bodies—one 
for each limb, the torso (including head), 
and the brain. In some cases, more 
bodies may be necessary. Special unguents 
and bindings worth 500 gp are also required. 
Note that creating a f lesh golem requires 
casting a spell with the evil descriptor.

Powerful Blows (Ex) An iron golem inflicts one and a half

An iron golem has a humanoid body made from iron. It 
can be sculpted into any shape its creator desires, but it 
almost always displays armor of some sort, from simple 
and utilitarian to ceremonial and ornate. Its features 
are much smoother than those of a stone golem. 
Iron golems sometimes carry a weapon in one hand, 
though they rarely use these, relying 
instead on their slam attacks. 
An iron golem is 12 feet tall and 
weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron 
golem cannot speak or make any 
vocal noise, nor does it have any 
distinguishable odor.
Although the practice 
has fallen out of favor 
in modern times, the 
ancients of certain powerful 
civilizations once took 
great pride in crafting iron 
golems of tremendous size 
and strength. These golems, 
which are never smaller than 
Huge, still exist in remote 
parts of the world, mindlessly 
following the orders of a long-
dead empire.
Construction
An iron golem’s body is sculpted from 5,000 
pounds of iron, smelted with rare tinctures 
costing at least 10,000 gp.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Immunity to Magic (Ex) A stone golem is 
immune to any spell or spell-like ability that 
allows spell resistance. In addition, certain 
spells and effects function differently against the 
creature, as noted below.
•	A	transmute rock to mud spell slows a stone golem 
(as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, 
while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.
•	A	stone to flesh spell does not actually change the 
golem’s structure but negates its damage reduction and 
immunity to magic for 1 full round.
Slow (Su) A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as 
a free action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 
10 feet in a burst centered on the golem and a duration of 7 
rounds, requiring a DC 17 Will save to negate. The save DC 
is Constitution-based.
A stone golem has a humanoid body made from stone, 
frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might 
look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved 
on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of 
its limbs. Its head is often carved to resemble a helmet or 
the head of some beast. While it may be sculpted to carry a 
stone shield or stone weapon such as a sword, these aesthetic 
choices do not affect its combat abilities.

Like most golems, a stone golem cannot speak and 
makes no sound other than the grinding of stone against 
stone when it moves. A stone golem is 9 feet tall and weighs 
around 2,000 pounds.
Construction
A stone golem’s body is chiseled from a single block of hard 
stone, such as granite, weighing at least 3,000 pounds. The

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A wood golem is immune to any 
spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with 
the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that have the 
Fire descriptor, which affect it normally. In addition, certain 
spells and effects function differently against the creature, 
as noted below.
•	Warp wood or wood shape slows a wood golem (as the 
slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save).
•	Repel wood drives the golem back 60 feet and deals 
2d12 points of damage to it (no save).
•	A	magical	attack	that	deals	cold	damage	breaks	
any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 
point of damage for every 3 points of 
damage the attack would otherwise deal. 
If the amount of healing would cause 
the golem to exceed its full normal hit 
points, it gains any excess as temporary 
hit points. A wood golem gets no saving 
throw against attacks that deal cold 
damage.
Splintering (Su) As a free action once every 1d4+1 
rounds, a wood golem can launch a barrage of razor-sharp 
wooden splinters from its body in a 20-foot-radius burst. 
All creatures caught within this area take 6d6 points of 
slashing damage (Reflex DC 14 halves). The save DC is 
Constitution-based.

A wood golem is carved from rare woods, assembled into 
a roughly humanoid body with articulated limbs. Their 
creators usually leave their bodies almost unfinished, with 
individual pieces of lumber and unworked wood apparent 
and obvious as part of their construction. A wood golem 
stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
Construction
The pieces of a wood golem are assembled from blocks of 
fine wood and sprinkled with rare powders and crushed 
herbs worth at least 300 gp.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon A gorgon can use its breath 
weapon once every 1d4+1 rounds to 
create a 60-foot cone of green gas. 
Those caught in the area of the gas can 
attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save to 
resist the effects, but those who fail 
the save are immediately petrified. 
This petrification is temporary—each 
round, a petrified creature can attempt 
a new DC 21 Fortitude save to recover from the 
petrification as long as it is not caught within the area 
of effect of the gorgon’s breath weapon a second time 
while petrified. A creature exposed to the gorgon’s breath a 
second time while already petrified becomes permanently 
petrified, and can no longer attempt to make additional 
Fortitude saves to recover naturally. The save 
DC is Constitution-based.
Gorgons are magical, foul-tempered 
creatures—while they might appear 

to be constructs at first glance, beneath their artifical-
looking armor plates they are made of flesh and bone. Like 
aggressive bulls, they challenge any unfamiliar creature 
they encounter, often trampling their opponent’s corpse 
or shattering its stony remnants until the creature is 
unrecognizable. The females are just as dangerous as the 
males, and the two sexes appear identical. A typical gorgon 
stands 6 feet tall and 8 feet long. It weighs 4,000 pounds.
Gorgons derive nutrients from the consumption 
of minerals, particularly the stone of their petrified 
victims, and any statues they create are likely to be 
gnawed thoroughly. They cannot digest metal or gems, 
so their dung (which resembles bitter-smelling gray 
powder) often contains small, raw crystals and nuggets 
of ore. Their aggression toward all other creatures 
means that there are few to no predators or other prey 
animals in their grazing grounds. Each herd is led by a 
dominant bull; solitary gorgons are usually adolescent 
bulls driven out of their herd by the lead bull.
Their f lesh is tough but beefy (once the armored hide 
is removed), and to those who acquire the taste, quite 
filling. Many stone giant tribes believe eating gorgon 
meat enhances their own natural armor. Powdered 
gorgon horn is worth 250 gp as an alternate material 
component for magic items using bull’s strength, stoneskin, 
f lesh to stone, statue, and similar magic.

This bull-like creature seems to be made of interlocking metallic 
plates. Faint plumes of green smoke puff from its mouth.

Environment cold marshes and underground
Organization solitary
Treasure none
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) The digestive acid that covers a gray ooze dissolves 
metals and organic material, but not stone. Each slam and 
constrict attack deals 1d6 additional acid damage. Armor or 
clothing worn by a creature grappled by a gray ooze takes 
the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds 
on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon 
that strikes a gray ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the 
weapon’s wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The 
ooze’s touch deals 12 points of acid damage 
per round to wooden or metal objects, but the 
ooze must remain in contact with the material 
for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The 
save DCs are Constitution-based.
Transparent (Ex) Due to its lack of vivid 
coloration, a gray ooze is difficult to 
discern from its surroundings in most 
environments. A DC 15 Perception 
check is required to notice the 
gray ooze. Any creature 
that fails to notice a gray 
ooze and walks into it 
automatically suffers 
damage as if struck by the 
ooze’s slam attack and is 
immediately subject to a grab 
attempt by the ooze.

Slinking their way through cold swamps and bleary 
marshlands, or sometimes even dungeons and caverns, 
gray oozes consume any organic materials they encounter. 
Despite its lack of intelligence, the gray ooze is a most 
problematic creature due to its transparency. While 
the ooze cannot easily climb walls or swim, its habit of 
lurking in the thick mud that lines the banks of marsh 
pools or lying in harmless-looking pools on dull-colored 
dungeon f loors makes it dangerously easy to overlook 
and step on.
Some sages believe that the gray ooze is the result of a 
failed alchemical experiment, while others postulate that 
the first gray oozes spontaneously arose from a cesspit 
of magical detritus. Of course, these theories that gray 
oozes are not living organisms, but rather the alchemical 
result of an unfortunate mixture of rare caustic f luids 
and magical waste, are derided by many who dwell in 
areas plagued by the creatures but which do not have a 
long history of magical pollution.
Variant Gray Oozes
The gray ooze adapts readily and swiftly to changes in 
environments, the simple structure of its primeval form 
and its method of using fission to reproduce all but 
ensuring that such changes occur. Listed below are two 
such variants that adventurers have encountered.
Crystal Ooze (CR 4): The crystal ooze is an aquatic variant 
that dwells in deeper waters than most commonly found 
in the gray ooze’s beloved swamps. A crystal ooze has the 
aquatic subtype and a swim speed of 30 ft. The crystal ooze 
lacks the gray ooze’s constrict ability, but it does secrete a 
paralytic toxin that causes those whom it strikes to become 
paralyzed for 3d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw 
(the save DC is Constitution-based).
Id Ooze (CR 6): Perhaps the strangest 
variant gray oozes are those that have 
developed a rudimentary intelligence, 
including the ability to communicate 
telepathically with other oozes, or even the 
ability to blast enemies with pulses of raw 
mental power. Id oozes are advanced 
gray oozes with an Intelligence 
score of 2 (and thus gain skill 
ranks and feats—typically 4 
ranks in Stealth, Improved 
Initiative, and Toughness), can 
communicate basic empathic 
information with other id 
oozes within 100 feet via 
telepathy, and can use 
lesser confusion at will as 
a spell-like ability (CL 
equals the id ooze’s HD).

A seemingly mundane puddle, patch of moist stone, or glistening rock 
is suddenly revealed to be more as a terrible pseudopod lashes out.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Weakness (Su) A green hag’s claws sap strength from 
those she strikes. Each time a green hag hits a 
foe with her claw attack, the victim takes 2 points of 
Strength damage unless he resists the weakness with 
a DC 16 Fortitude save. Alternatively, a green hag can 
attempt to inflict even greater weakness on a foe by 
making a touch attack—this variant requires a standard 
action, and cannot be attempted in the same round the 
hag makes claw attacks. The opponent touched must 
succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of 
Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Mimicry (Ex) A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost 
any animal found near its lair.
Terrifying crones known to haunt foul swamps and tangled 
forests, green hags harbor an intense hatred for all 

beauty and purity. Making use of their varied deceptive 
abilities, these crones delight in murdering innocents, 
unhinging noble minds, and debasing the pure of heart. 
They are particularly fond of using disguise self to assume 
the forms of alluring young maidens and then seducing 
young men away from their lovers or families. In this 
form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens 
with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green 
hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a 
moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with 
horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and 
do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they 
seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the 
truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate lovers 
end up being eaten by their green hag companions—for 
the unlucky, their final doom can be much worse, for the 
cruel imagination of the green hag is vast. 
A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and 
weighs just under 160 pounds.
 Hag Covens
When three hags of any type 
gather, they can form a coven 
to gain increased magical 
ability. Any combination 
of hags can form a coven, 
but green hags are the most 
common members of such 
foul gatherings.
Whenever all three hags of a 
particular coven are within 10 
feet of one another, all three of 
them can work together to use 
any of the following spell-like 
abilities: animate dead, baleful 
polymorph (DC 18), blight (DC 17), bestow curse 
(DC 17), clairaudience/clairvoyance, charm 
monster (DC 17), commune, control weather, 
dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana 
(DC 18), reincarnate, speak with dead, veil 
(DC 19), vision.
All three hags must take a full-
round action to take part in this form of 
cooperative magic. All coven spell-like 
abilities function at CL 9th (or at the highest 
CL available to the most powerful hag in the 
coven). The save DCs are Charisma-based, 
and function as if with a Charisma score of 16 unless 
one of the hags has a higher Charisma score, in which 
case the spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that 
hag’s Charisma modifier.
At the GM’s discretion, certain more powerful hag 
covens might have additional spell-like abilities.

Griffons are powerful aerial predators, 
swooping down from their high aeries to take 
their prey with beak and talon. Aggressive and 
territorial, they are no mere beasts, but rather 
calculating combatants and loyal companions to those 
who earn their respect, fighting to the death to protect 
their friends and kin.
Weighing in at over 500 pounds and measuring 8 feet 
long from hooked beak to tufted tail, the griffon strikes an 
imposing silhouette that has long been used in heraldry 
and other iconography as a symbol of power, authority, 
and justice. In reality, the griffon is less concerned with 
abstract concepts than with hunting food and protecting 
its own. While they can sometimes be trained or 
befriended to serve as mounts, griffons have no inherent 
affinity for humanoids, and frequently come into bloody 
conflict with civilized races over their attempts to secure 
their favorite food—horse f lesh. City folk may marvel at 
the trained griffon’s stately manner and 25-foot wingspan, 
but those farmers forced to share territory with its wild 
kin know to hurry home and secure their barns when the 
beasts’ hunting shrieks split the sky.

This majestic beast has the body of a lion, the head and forelegs of 
a great eagle, and a massive pair of feathered wings.

Griffons mate for life, and will often search for years 
to take vengeance over a slain mate or child. It was likely 
this innate stubbornness and fierce loyalty that first 
brought them into domestic use as mounts and guardians 
of treasure hoards. Despite the inherent danger, trade in 
captured griffons and stolen eggs is brisk, with their eggs 
worth up to 3,500 gp apiece and live young twice that. 
Characters eager for griffon mounts, however, should 
note that buying or forcibly domesticating intelligent 
creatures like griffons is still recognized as slavery by 
most good deities, and winning a griffon’s allegiance 
of its own free will is no easy task. Reaching a mutually 
agreeable accord (or even a friendship) is a much more 
elegant and safe route to securing a griffon mount.
Before it can be ridden in combat, a griffon requires 
practice bearing the weight of its rider. In order to be 
trained successfully, a griffon must first be helpful toward 
its trainer (possibly requiring a Diplomacy, Intimidate, 
or Handle Animal check). After that, 6 weeks of practice 
and a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check is sufficient 
for the beast to be comfortable with its burden, and due 
to their intelligence, trained griffons can be treated as 
knowing every trick listed in the Handle Animal skill 
description, possibly even responding to new, simple 
requests made in Common.
Griffons can carry up to 300 pounds as a light load, 
600 pounds as a medium load, and 900 pounds as a heavy 
load. Riding a griffon requires an exotic saddle.

Half-dragons are only rarely the result of dragons mating 
with other creatures—most are the result of strange 
magical experiments. In most cases, a successful 
creation breeds true with others of its kind, as with 
the dreaded dracolisk.
Creating a Half-Dragon
“Half-dragon” is an inherited or acquired 
template that can be added to any living, 
corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base 
creature). A half-dragon retains all the base creature’s 
statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
CR: Same as the base creature + 2 (minimum 3).
Type: Creature type changes to dragon. Do not 
recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.
Armor Class: Nat. armor improves by +4.
Special Qualities and Defenses: A 
  half-dragon gains darkvision 60 feet; 
low-light vision; and immunity to sleep, 
paralysis, and energy of the same type as 
its breath weapon.
Speed: A half-dragon has wings. 
Unless the base creature has a better f ly 

speed, the half-dragon can f ly at twice the creature’s base 
land speed (average maneuverability).
Melee: A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite 
attack. If the base creature can use manufactured weapons, 
the half-dragon can as well. A new claw or bite attack deals 
damage as appropriate for the half-dragon’s size (see 
“Natural Attacks” on pages 301–302).
Special Abilities: A half-dragon retains all the special 
attacks of the base creature and gains a breath weapon 
usable once per day based on the dragon variety (see below). 
The breath weapon deals 1d6 hit points of damage per 
racial HD possessed by the half-dragon (Ref lex half; DC 10 
+ 1/2 creature’s racial HD + creature’s Con modifier).
Dragon Variety Breath Weapon
Black or copper 60-foot line of acid
Brass 60-foot line of fire
Blue or bronze 60-foot line of electricity
Gold or red 30-foot cone of fire
Green 30-foot cone of acid
Silver or white 30-foot cone of cold
Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str 
+8, Con +6, Int +2, Cha +2.
Skills: A half-dragon with racial Hit Dice has skill points 
per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier. 
Racial class skills are unchanged from the base creature’s.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Captivating Song (Su) A harpy’s song has the power to infect 
the minds of those that hear it, calling them to the harpy’s 
side. When a harpy sings, all creatures aside from other 
harpies within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 
16 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that 
successfully saves is not subject to the same harpy’s song 
for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the captivating 
song moves toward the harpy using the most direct means 
available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such 
as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second 
saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. 
Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to 
defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the harpy 
simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy’s 
attacks. This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings 
and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting 
charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Often viewed as vicious and corrupted creatures, harpies 
know how creatures think and act. This understanding 
gives them an advantage when it comes to finding their 
favorite meals. While creatures of the wild easily fall 
victim to their captivating songs, these vile bird-women 

prefer their meals spiced with complex sentient thoughts. 
Easy prey makes for a boring meal.
While ultimately savage and without remorse for their 
actions, a number of harpies live close to humanoid 
societies and enjoy parlaying with creatures that they see 
as potential meals.
Harpies tend to wear baubles and trinkets stolen 
from their victims, as they like to indulge in the shiny 
ornaments of mankind. Up close, these creatures reek 
with the stench of consumed victims, and they rarely let 
creatures not yet captivated too near, lest they smell the 
gore and decay upon their feathers. For this reason, many 
harpies wear perfumes and scented oils.
Harpies appear wildly different in different lands. Some 
seem like an amalgam of vultures and women, while others 
bear the regal markings of hawks or falcons in their 
feathers. Rare clutches of harpies in isolated 
and tropical parts of the world even have 
colorful feathers akin to parrots.

Save for the tattered wings and taloned feet, this creature 
resembles a feral woman with a wild look about her.

A typical hell hound stands 4–5 
feet tall at the shoulder and 
weighs 120 pounds. Efficient 
hunters, a favorite pack tactic is 
to surround prey quietly, then 
attack with one or two hounds, 
driving prey toward the rest of 
the pack with their fiery breath. 
If the prey doesn’t run, the pack 
closes in. Hell hounds track 
f leeing creatures relentlessly.
Hell hounds are particularly 
favored by fire giants, as the 
creatures are immune to fire 
and share the fire giant’s sense 
of cruelty when it comes to 
handling intruders. Only when 
a fire giant goes too far toward 
treating a relatively intelligent hell 
hound like a pet do such alliances 
begin to falter.

Bison are large herd animals. They can grow as long 
as 12 feet and as tall as 7 feet at the shoulder. Average 
bison weigh 2,200 pounds. The bison’s statistics can 
be used for almost any larger herd animal, such 
as the buffalo.
Bison frighten far less easily than 
their domesticated cousins and 
are much more aggressive 
when protecting the herd 
or their young. Adult 
bulls are extremely 
confontational in 
mating season, and 
even kill one another 
in pursuit of particular 
females. After mating 
season, herds of 
bison tend to separate 
into smaller herds in 
preparation for the 
arrival of new calves.
Bison companions 
are identical to 
aurochs animal 
companions.

Hobgoblins are militaristic and 
fecund, a combination that makes 
them quite dangerous in some 
regions. They breed quickly, replacing 
fallen members with new soldiers 
and keeping up their numbers despite 
the fortunes of war. They generally 
need little reason to declare war, 
but more often than not that 
reason is to capture new slaves—
life as a slave in a hobgoblin 
lair is brutal and short, and new 
slaves are always needed to replace 
those who fall or are eaten.
Of all the goblinoid races, the 
hobgoblin is by far the most civilized. 

They see the larger and more solitary bugbears as tools to 
be hired and used where appropriate, usually for specific 
missions involving assassination and stealth, and look 
upon their smaller goblin kin with a mix of shame 
and frustration. Hobgoblins admire goblin tenacity, 
yet their miniscule kindred’s unpredictable nature 
and fondness for fire make them unwelcome additions 
to hobgoblin tribes or settlements. Nonetheless, most 
hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins, 
typically squatting in the most undesirable corners of 
the settlement.
Many hobgoblin tribes combine their love of warfare 
with keen intellects. The science of siege engines, 
alchemy, and complex Feats of engineering fascinate 
most hobgoblins, and those who are particularly skilled 
are treated as heroes and invariably secure high-ranking 
positions in the tribe. Slaves with analytical minds are 
quite valued, and as such raids on dwarven cities are 
commonplace.
 It is well known that hobgoblins 
mistrust and even despise magic, 
particularly arcane magic. Their 
shamans are treated with a mix of 
fear and respect, and are usually 
forced to live alone on the 
fringes of the tribe’s lair. It is 
all but unheard of to find a 
hobgoblin practicing arcane 
magic, or as hobgoblins 
call it, “elf magic.” This is 
the root of their hatred of 
magic—the hobgoblins’ hatred 
of elves.
A hobgoblin stands 5 feet tall and 
weighs 160 pounds.
Hobgoblin Characters
Hobgoblins are defined by their class 
levels—they do not possess racial Hit 
Dice. All hobgoblins have the following 
racial traits.

Telepathic Link (Su) A homunculus cannot speak, but the 
process of creating one links it telepathically with its 
creator. A homunculus knows what its master knows and 
can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, out 
to a distance of 1,500 feet.
A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a 
spellcaster from his own blood. They are weak combatants 
but make effective spies, messengers, and scouts. A 
homunculus’s creator determines its precise features; 
some are more refined looking, but most creators don’t 
bother to improve the creature’s appearance beyond the 
minimum necessary for functioning.
Homunculi are little more than tools designed to 
carry out assigned tasks. They are extensions of their 
creators, sharing the same alignment and basic nature. 

A homunculus never willingly travels more than a mile 
from its master, though it can be removed forcibly. If 
this occurs, the creature does everything in its power 
to return to this range, as it cannot communicate with 
its master beyond this distance. An attack that destroys 
a homunculus deals 2d10 points 
of damage to its master. If the 
creature’s master is slain, the 
homunculus goes insane—it 
loses its Intelligence score, 
all feats, and all skill 
ranks, and generally 
claims the immediate 
surroundings as its 
domain, mindlessly 
attacking any who 
intrude upon its lair.
On rare occasions, 
a homunculus freed 
from its servitude rises 
above its master’s original 
intent and becomes more 
than a half-insane construct 
guardian of a long-forgotten 
lair. In some cases, a homunculus might even 
come to see itself as the rightful heir to its 
master’s legacy, or even the reincarnated 
spirit of the master himself.
Construction
A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ash, 
mandrake root, spring water, and one pint of the creator’s 
own blood. These materials cost 50 gp. After the body is 
sculpted, it is animated through an extended magical 
ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or 
workroom, similar to an alchemist’s laboratory, and 
costing an additional 1,000 gp to supply. If the creator is 
personally constructing the creature’s body, the building 
and ritual can be performed together. A homunculus with 
more than 2 Hit Dice can be created, but each additional 
Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the cost to create.
The person whose blood is used to form a homunculus’s 
body becomes its master; it is possible for one person to 
give blood for the creation, another to sculpt the base 
material, and another to magically animate it as a minion 
for the one who provided the blood.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Docile (Ex) Unless specifically trained for combat (see the Handle 
Animal skill on page 97 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), a 
horse’s hooves are treated as secondary attacks.
Horses stand 5 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and 
weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds.
The statistics above are for a typical riding 
horse, called by some a “light horse.” Some 
horses are larger and heartier, bred for labor 
such as pulling plows or carriages. These 
horses are called “heavy horses” and 
gain the following adjustments to 
the base statistics detailed above.
Heavy Horse: A heavy 
horse gains the advanced 
simple template. In 
addition, it also gains a 
bite attack that inflicts 
1d4 damage, and its 
hoof damage increases 
to 1d6. As with a light 
horse, a heavy horse can 
be specifically trained for 
combat with the Handle 
Animal skill.

Ponies are smaller breeds 
of horses better suited to 
halflings, gnomes, and 
dwarves, but they 
also make fond 
pets for 
humans as 
well. They 
stand 3 to 4 
feet tall and weigh 
about 600 pounds.
A light load for a pony is 
up to 100 pounds, a medium 
load is 101–200 pounds, 
and a heavy load is 201–300 
pounds. A pony can drag 
1,500 pounds.
The statistics presented 
above are for a typical pony. Tougher 
ponies with the advanced simple template 
exist, but are relatively uncommon and, unlike 
horses, these creatures are not generally called “heavy 
ponies.” Like horses, ponies can be trained for combat 
with the Handle Animal skill, and such mounts often 
serve half lings, gnomes, and other small races as steeds 
in combat.

This proud horse thunders across the grassy plain with f luid 
grace, wind tugging at its loose-fitting barding. 

This squat equine plods forward with large, curious eyes. As it

SPECIAL ABILITIES
fast healing (Ex) A hydra’s fast healing ability is equal to its 
current number of heads (minimum fast healing 5). This fast 
healing applies only to damage inflicted on the hydra’s body.
hydra Traits (Ex) A hydra can be killed by severing all of 
its heads or slaying its body. Any attack that is not an 
attempt to sever a head affects the body, including area 
attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning 
damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a 
sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting a head. 
A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 
and hit points equal to the hydra’s HD. To sever a head, 
an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce 
the head’s hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals 
damage to the hydra’s body equal to the hydra’s current 
HD. A hydra can’t attack with a severed head, but takes no 
other penalties.
Regenerate head (Ex) When a hydra’s head is destroyed, two 
heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A hydra cannot have more 
than twice its original number of heads at any one time. To 
prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid 
or fire damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack 
to hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area 
attacks can affect stumps and the body simultaneously. A 

Multiple angry snake-like heads rise from the sleek, serpentine 
body of this terrifying monster.

hydra doesn’t die from losing its heads until all are cut off 
and the stumps seared by acid or fire.
You can make more powerful hydras by increasing their 
Hit Dice—each added HD increases the hydra’s statistics as 
appropriate, but also gives it one additional head and a +1 
increase to its natural armor. A hydra’s CR increases by +1 
for each Hit Die it gains.
Cryohydra/Pyrohydra (+2 CR): Variants of the standard 
hydra, the cryohydra lives in cold marshes or on glaciers, 
while the pyrohydra prefers deserts or volcanic mountains. 
A cryohydra gains the Cold subtype, while a pyrohydra gains 
the Fire subtype. Each of its heads has a breath weapon (15-
ft. cone, 3d6 cold damage [cryohydra] or 3d6 fire damage 
[pyrohydra], Reflex half) useable every 1d4 rounds. The save 
DC is 10 + 1/2 the hydra’s HD + the hydra’s Con modifier. 
Although fire attacks cannot prevent a pyrohydra’s neck 
stump from growing new heads (since it is immune to fire), 
5 points of cold damage does. Acid works normally on both 
hydra variants.

Hyenas are pack hunters infamous for their cunning and 
their unnerving, laughter-like vocalizations. They are 
largely scavengers, but aren’t above supplementing their 
diet of carrion with fresh prey.
Hyenas tend to hunt alone, but when hunting as a pack 
they typically send one or two members against a foe’s 
front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks 
from behind.
Many of the savage humanoid 
races, particularly gnolls, use 
hyenas as guard dogs. Such hyenas 
typically wear leather barding and 
are trained from birth to be vicious 
and savage—many such creatures 
are advanced hyenas.

Dire hyenas (known to many as hyaenodons) are more 
fearsome than their smaller cousins. While hyaenodons 
won’t turn down carrion as a handy meal, they much prefer 
to hunt for prey. A pack of dire hyenas rarely stops moving 
and hunting for anything other than sleep, mating, or 
food. Hyaenodons are 6 feet tall at the 
shoulder and often over 12 feet long. 
They weigh 900 pounds.
Gnolls have been known to 
train hyaenodons to serve in 
their lairs as guardians, 
or more commonly as 
fearsome mounts.

This hyena is covered in shaggy, tan-colored fur with black and 
brown stripes.

This large hyena has a thick head, rheumy red eyes, and a mouth 
filled with sharp, powerful teeth.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Body Thief (Su) As a full-round action that provokes 
an attack of opportunity, an intellect devourer can 
reduce its size, crawl into the mouth of a helpless 
or dead creature, and burrow into the victim’s 
skull to devour its brain. This is a coup de grace 
attempt that inflicts 8d4+3d6+8 points of damage. 
If the victim is slain (or already dead), the intellect 
devourer usurps control of the body and may use it 
as its own, as if it controlled the target via a dominate 
monster spell. The intellect devourer has full access to 
all of the host’s defensive and offensive abilities save 
for spellcasting and spell-like abilities (although the 
intellect devourer can still use its own 
spell-like abilities). A host body may not 

have been dead for longer than 1 day for this ability to 
function, and even successfully inhabited bodies decay 
to uselessness in 7 days (unless this time is extended via 
gentle repose). As long as the intellect devourer occupies 
the body, it knows (and can speak) the languages known 
by the victim and basic information about the victim’s 
identity and personality, yet has none of the victim’s 
specific memories or knowledge. Damage done to a host 
body does not harm the intellect devourer, and if the host 
body is slain, the intellect devourer emerges and is dazed 
for 1 round. Raise dead cannot restore a victim of body 
theft, but resurrection or more powerful magic can.
Vulnerable to Protection from Evil (Ex) An intellect devourer 
is treated as a summoned creature for the purpose of 
determining how it is affected by a protection from evil spell.
Thought by some to be invaders from another dimension 
or planet, the sinister intellect devourers are certainly one 
of the world’s cruelest races. Incapable of experiencing 
emotions or wallowing in the sins of physical pleasure on 
their own, intellect devourers are forced to steal bodies in 
order to indulge their gluttony, lust, and cruelty. Stories 
tell of entire cities of these creatures deep underground, 
where host bodies are worn like clothes to hideous orgies 
and vile feasts. Lone intellect devourers often dwell in 
ruins or caves on the edge of a civilized region so they can 
make periodic forays into town to “shop” for an attractive 
new body.
An intellect devourer is 3 feet long and weighs about 
60 pounds.

Devoid of a head, or any features at all save for four short, clawed 
legs, this creature’s body looks like a large, glistening brain.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Improved Tracking (Ex) An invisible stalker takes no penalty to 
Survival checks when tracking and moving at any speed. 
natural Invisibility (Ex) This ability is constant—an invisible 
stalker remains invisible at all times, even when attacking. 
As this ability is inherent, it is not subject to the invisibility 
purge spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, the 
invisible stalker gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when 
moving, or +40 when standing still—these bonuses are not 
included in the statistics above.
Very little is known about these enigmatic and mysterious 
creatures, as their very nature makes details of their true 
form difficult to discern. Brought to this world from 
the Plane of Air, these creatures fulfill tasks for those 
who conjure them. Invisible stalkers act as guardians, 
assassins, and trackers, occupations in which they excel. 
Their natural invisibility and skill at stealth allow them 
to follow their quarry without detection and give them the 
upper hand when it comes to exterminating a mark.
Many invisible stalkers resent this and see these petty 
tasks as nothing more than chores dictated by mortals. 
When given a particularly complex or bothersome task, an 

invisible stalker seeks to find a loophole in a poorly worded 
instruction. For instance, wizards calling an invisible 
stalker into service with the instructions “protect me 
from danger” might find themselves escorted to a faraway 
hidden location, or even brought to the Plane of Air.
Due to their constant summoning, many invisible 
stalkers harbor hostility for those dwelling on the Material 
Plane. Those invisible stalkers new to the mortal world 
only know the stories of their kind and tend to keep an 
open mind about the intentions of those who call them. 
Over time, or in the service of a particularly vile master, 
invisible stalkers form negative opinions of these creatures 
of f lesh and bone, leading to their tendency to pervert 
their instructions and cause harm to their masters. For 
older and more experienced invisible stalkers, the only 
thing protecting those who summon them is the magic 
that binds them. These creatures automatically try to use 
inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal 
twists on the intention to find a way to inconvenience, 
injure, or even kill the priest or arcanist that brought them 
to the plane.

No true form can be detected, yet a sense of force and hulking 
malevolence is undeniable in this creature’s presence.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
find Target (Su) Once per day, an iron cobra’s creator can 
order it to find and kill a specific creature within 1 mile, 
which it does as if guided by discern location. The creator 
must have seen or be holding an item from the specified 
creature for this order to function.
Poison (Ex) An iron cobra’s bite injects poison from a hidden 
reservoir within its body. Because it is a construct, the 
cobra does not naturally produce this poison, and its creator 
must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir holds 
enough poison for 3 successful bite attacks, after which the 
creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir 
takes 5 rounds and provokes attacks of opportunity. The 
creator can fill the reservoir with any injury poison (typically 
black adder venom), though acid, alchemical substances, 
and even stranger liquids have been used. 
Black Adder Venom: Bite—injury; save Fort DC 11; frequency 
1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save.
The iron cobra is a simple construct that resembles 
a hooded cobra made out of metal. The iron cobra is 
typically used as a bodyguard or guardian of treasure, 
though its magical ability to unerringly locate creatures 
means it is also used as an assassin. Since an 
iron cobra’s poison reservoir can contain 
multiple types of venom, the construct’s 
specific use can be further tailored by 

varying the poison used. Some spellcasters even fill these 
reservoirs with potions, so that when the cobra bites, it 
injects the potion into its target. This is a somewhat 
dangerous method for gaining the effects of a potion, but 
it does free up the cobra’s master to do other things in a 
combat round apart from quaffing potions.
Iron is the most common material for these creations, 
but some crafters prefer more exotic materials when 
creating the serpentine constructs.
Adamantine Cobra (+1 CR): This cobra is more solidly 
built than others. Its natural armor bonus increases to 
+12, it gains +5 hp per HD, and it gains DR 10/—.
Darkwood Cobra (+0 CR): This cobra is more mobile; it 
gains a swim speed of 30 ft. and a climb speed of 20 ft.
Mithral Cobra (+1 CR): This cobra is much swifter. Its 
Dexterity increases by +4 and its speed to 70 ft., and it can 
make 2 bite attacks per round as a full attack action.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Crafty (Ex) Craft (trapmaking) and 
Stealth are always class skills for a 
kobold.
Kobolds are creatures of the dark, 
found most commonly in enormous 
underground warrens or the dark 

corners of the forest where the sun is unable to reach. Due 
to their physical similarities, kobolds loudly proclaim 
themselves the scions of dragonkind, destined to rule the 
earth beneath the wings of their great god-cousins, but 
most dragons have little use for the obnoxious pests.
While they may speak loudly of divine right and 
manifest destiny, kobolds are keenly aware of their own 
weakness. Cowards and schemers, they never fight fair if 
they can help it, instead setting up ambushes and double-
crosses, holing up in their warrens behind countless 
crude but ingenious traps, or rolling over the enemy in 
vast, yipping hordes.
Kobold coloration varies even among siblings from 
the same egg clutch, ranging through the colors of the 
chromatic dragons, with red being the most common but 
white, green, blue, and black kobolds not unheard of.
Kobold Characters
Kobolds are defined by their class levels—they do not 
possess racial Hit Dice. A kobold with NPC class levels 
takes a –3 penalty to its CR (rather than the normal –2 
penalty). All kobolds have the following racial traits.
–4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, –2 Constitution: Kobolds 
are fast but weak.
Small: Kobolds are Small and gain a +1 size 
bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, 
a –1 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 
size bonus on Stealth checks.
Normal Speed: Kobolds have a base 
speed of 30 feet.
Darkvision: Kobolds can see in the dark up to 
60 feet.
Armor: Kobolds have a +1 natural 
armor bonus.
Crafty: Kobolds gain a 
+2 racial bonus on Craft 
(trapmaking), Perception, 
and Profession 
(miner) checks. Craft 
(trapmaking) and 
Stealth are always class 
skills for a kobold.
Weakness: Light 
sensitivity (see page 301).
Languages: Kobolds 
begin play speaking 
only Draconic. 
Kobolds who have 
high Intelligence 
scores can choose 
any of the following bonus 
languages: Common, Dwarven, 
Gnome, and Undercommon.

This short, reptilian humanoid has scaled skin, a snout filled 
with tiny teeth, and a long tail.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ink Cloud (Ex) A kraken can emit a cloud of black, 
venomous ink in an 80-foot spread once per 
minute as a free action while underwater. This 
cloud provides total concealment, which the 
kraken can use to escape a fight that is going 
badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to 
be in darkness. In addition, the ink is toxic, functioning 
as contact poison against all creatures caught within it. 
The ink cloud persists for 1 minute before 
dispersing. The save DC against the poison 
effect is Constitution-based. 
Kraken Ink: Ink cloud—contact; save Fort 
DC 29; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1 
Str damage plus nausea; cure 2 consecutive saves.

This tremendous leviathan resembles a vast squid, yet the 
markings on its body are strangely unsettling to look upon.

jet (Ex) A kraken can jet backward as a full-round action, at a 
speed of 280 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does 
not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
Rend Ship (Ex) As a full-round action, a kraken can attempt 
to use four of its tentacles to grapple a ship of its size 
or smaller. It makes a CMB check opposed by the ship’s 
captain’s Profession (sailor) check, but the kraken gets a 
cumulative +4 bonus on the check for each size category 
smaller than Gargantuan the ship is. If the kraken 
grapples the ship, it holds the ship motionless; it can 
attack targets anywhere on or within the ship with its 
tentacles, but can only attack foes on deck with its free 
arms and can’t attack foes at all with its beak. Each round 
it maintains its hold on the ship, it automatically inflicts 
bite damage on the ship’s hull.
Tenacious grapple (Ex) A kraken does not gain the grappled 
condition if it grapples a foe with its arms or tentacles.
The legendary kraken is one of the greatest of sailors’ 
fears, for here is a creature the size of a whale, one that 
can strike from the unseen depths below, can command 
the winds and weather that a ship needs to move, and 
possesses the cruel intellect of the world’s most creative 
and spiteful criminals. Some believe krakens to 
be a punishment of the gods, while others 
hold them to be the true lords of the deep, 
with the air-breathing races naught but 
their cattle.
A kraken measures nearly 100 
feet in length and weighs 
4,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Chain Armor (Ex) The chains that adorn 
a kyton grant it a +4 armor bonus, 
but are not treated as armor for the 
purpose of arcane spell failure, armor 
check penalties, maximum Dexterity, 
weight, or proficiency.
Dancing Chains (Su) A kyton can control 
up to four chains within 20 feet as a 
standard action, making the chains dance 
or move as it wishes. In addition, a kyton 
can increase these chains’ length by up to 15 feet 
and cause them to sprout razor-edged barbs. These 
chains attack as effectively as the kyton itself. If 
a chain is in another creature’s possession, the 

Wickedly barbed chains adorn this lean figure, and gaps in the 
bindings reveal deathly pale f lesh etched with jagged scars.

KKrraakkeenn––KKyyttoonn

creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the kyton’s 
power over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton 
cannot attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 
hours or until the chain leaves the creature’s possession. A 
kyton can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without 
making Climb checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Unnerving gaze (Su) Range 30 ft., Will DC 15 negates. A kyton 
can make its face resemble one of an opponent’s departed 
loved ones or bitter enemies. Those who fail their saves 
become shaken for 1d3 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear 
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Often classified among the ranks of the infernal and called 
chain devils by the uninitiated, the sadomasochistic 
kytons are not true devils. Although some 
are known to live in Hell, kytons 
exist outside of the hierarchies 
established by Asmodeus and his 
archdevils and can often be found 
on other planes, particularly 
on the Plane of Shadow. Many 
suggest that kytons were natives 
of Hell who existed there before 
the advent of devilkind, while 
others hypothesize they were 
later brought to the plane by some 
sadistic power. Regardless of their 
origins, kytons roam the planes 
in their lust to cause and receive 
suffering, seeking pain through 
violent abductions and sadistic 
debauches.
The kyton presented here is a 
typical member of this fiendish race 
of outsiders, but is by no means the 
only type of its kind. Just as there 
are numerous different species of 
demon and devil, rumor holds that 
different kinds of kytons dwell in their 
jangling cities in Hell and on the Plane 
of Shadow. These kytons are invariably 
more powerful than the one presented 
here, often having spell-like abilities or 
hideous and unsettling special attacks 
along the themes of torture and pain. 
Rumor holds that the most powerful 
kytons are completely inhuman, 
and that these monsters are the 
true progenators of the kyton 
race—the kyton presented 
here but the result of unholy 
dalliances with their 
unfortunate victims. 185

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a lamia is Large, 
its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium 
humanoid. As a result, lamias wield weapons as if they 
were one size category smaller than their actual size 
(Medium for most lamias).
Wisdom Drain (Su) A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom 
each time it hits with its melee touch attack. (Unlike with 
other kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia does not heal 
any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.) Lamias try to 
use this power early in an encounter to make foes more 
susceptible to charm monster and suggestion.
The hate-filled inheritors of an ancient curse, lamias 
appear as lean and attractive women from the waist up, 
while below they possess the bodies of powerful lions. Even 

their humanoid features bear distinctly feline traits, their 
eyes slitted and feral and their teeth like predatory fangs. 
A typical lamia stands over 6 feet tall, measures more than 
8 feet long, and weighs upward of 650 pounds.
Lamias are attracted to the ruined and forsaken parts of 
the world. Crumbling keeps, abandoned cities, and forgotten 
monuments all satisfy these deadly hunters’ cruel aesthetic—
particularly those in arid or otherwise lifeless environs. 
Foremost, though, lamias favor decrepit temples. They 
delight in seeing the shrines of good deities in ruins and go 
out of their way to bring hardship to thriving holy places.
Lamias look to the eldest female of the group as their 
leader, mother, and shaman, cleaving to her with fanatical 
reverence. While lamias shun most religious followings—
viewing such as the source of the curse that blighted 
them with bestial forms—lamia elders claim to hear the 
whispers of the scouring desert winds and know the cold 
whims of the stars, drawing upon such mystical sources to 
lead their people.
The lamias presented here are but the most common and 
least powerful members of this cursed race, with others 
bearing serpentine, avian, and even more perverse forms.

This creature’s upper torso is that of a comely woman with cat’s 
eyes and sharp fangs, while her lower body is that of a lion.

it latches onto its target and automatically 
grapplies. The giant leech loses its Dexterity 
bonus to AC and has an AC of 10, but 
holds on with great tenacity and 
automatically inflicts bite damage each 
round. A giant leech has a +8 racial 
bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe 
once it is attached. An attached giant 
leech can be struck with a weapon or 
grappled itself—if its prey manages to 
win a grapple check or Escape Artist check 
against it, the giant leech is removed.
Blood Drain (Ex) A giant leech drains blood at the 
end of each turn it is attached, inflicting 1 point 
of Strength and Constitution damage.
Susceptible to Salt (Ex) A handful of salt burns 
a giant leech as if it were a flask of acid, 
causing 1d6 points of damage per use.

*Necromancer power (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, pages 81–82)
Few creatures are more feared than the lich. The pinnacle 
of necromantic art, the lich is a spellcaster who has chosen 
to shed his life as a method to cheat death by becoming 
undead. While many who reach such heights of power stop 
at nothing to achieve immortality, the idea of becoming a 
lich is abhorrent to most creatures. The process involves the 
extraction of the spellcaster’s life-force and its imprisonment 
in a specially prepared phylactery—the spellcaster gives up 
life, but in trapping life he also traps his death, and as long 
as his phylactery remains intact he can continue on in his 
research and work without fear of the passage of time.
The quest to become a lich is a lengthy one. While 
construction of the magical phylactery to contain the 
spellcaster’s soul is a critical component, a prospective lich 
must also learn the secrets of transferring his soul into the 
receptacle and of preparing his body for the transformation 
into undeath, neither of which are simple tasks. Further 
complicating the ritual is the fact that no two bodies or souls 
are exactly alike—a ritual that works for one spellcaster 
might simply kill another or drive him insane. The exact 
methods for each spellcaster’s transformation are left to 
the GM’s discretion, but should involve expenditures of 
hundreds of thousands of gold pieces, numerous deadly 
adventures, and a large number of difficult skill checks 
over the course of months, years, or decades.
The Lich’s Phylactery
An integral part of becoming a lich is the creation of the 
phylactery in which the character stores his soul. The only 
way to get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. 
Unless its phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich can 
rejuvenate after it is killed (see Creating a Lich, below).
Each lich must create its own phylactery by using the 
Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to 
cast spells and have a caster level of 11th or higher. The 
phylactery costs 120,000 gp to create and has a caster level 
equal to that of its creator at the time of creation.
The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal 
box containing strips of parchment on which magical 
phrases have been transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 
hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40.
Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, 
amulets, or similar items.
Creating a Lich
“Lich” is an acquired template that can be added to any living 
creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided 
it can create the required phylactery. A lich retains all the base 
creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Lich

Lich

CR: Same as the base creature + 2.
Alignment: Any evil.
Type: The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not 
recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.
Senses: A lich gains darkvision 60 ft.
Armor Class: A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the 
base creature’s natural armor bonus, whichever is better.
Hit Dice: Change all of the creature’s racial Hit Dice 
to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain 
unchanged. As undead, liches use their Charisma modifiers 
to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).
Defensive Abilities: A lich gains channel resistance 
+4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and immunity to 
cold and electricity (in addition to those granted by 
its undead traits). The lich also gains the following 
defensive ability.
Rejuvenation (Su): When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery 
(which is generally hidden by the lich in a safe place far 
from where it chooses to dwell) immediately begins to 
rebuild the undead spellcaster’s body nearby. This process 
takes 1d10 days—if the body is destroyed before that time 
passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew. After 
this time passes, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without 
any gear it left behind on its old body), usually with a burning 
need for revenge against those who previously destroyed it.
Melee Attack: A lich has a touch attack that it can use 
once per round as a natural weapon. A lich fighting without 
weapons uses its natural weapons (if it has any) in addition 
to its touch attack (which is treated as a primary natural 
weapon that replaces one claw or slam attack, if the 
creature has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its 
weapons normally, and can use its touch attack as a 
secondary natural weapon.
Damage: A lich’s touch attack uses negative energy 
to deal 1d8 points of damage to living creatures + 1 
point of damage per 2 Hit Dice possessed by the lich. 
As negative energy, this damage can be used to heal 
undead creatures. A lich can take a full-round action 
to infuse itself with this energy, healing damage as 
if it had used its touch attack against itself.
Special Attacks: A lich gains the two special attacks 
described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich’s 
HD + lich’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.
Fear Aura (Su): Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-
foot radius that look at the lich must succeed on a Will 
save or become frightened. Creatures with 5 HD or 
more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken 
for a number of rounds equal to the lich’s Hit 
Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot 
be affected again by the same lich’s aura for 24 hours. 
This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Paralyzing Touch (Su): Any living creature a lich hits with 
its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be 

permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that 
can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse 
spell description, with a DC equal to the lich’s save DC). 
The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich 
seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 
Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive.
Abilities: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has 
no Constitution score.
Skills: Liches have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense 
Motive, and Stealth checks. A lich always treats Climb, Disguise, 
Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), 
Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. 
Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a 
standard action, a crag linnorm can expel a 120-foot line of 
magma, dealing 15d8 points of fire damage to all creatures 
struck (Reflex DC 24 halves). This line of magma remains 
red-hot for 1 round after the linnorm creates it. Creatures 
that took damage on the first round take 6d6 fire damage 
the second round (Reflex DC 24 negates), as does any 
creature that walks across the line of magma. If 
the magma was expelled while the linnorm was 
airborne, it instead rains downward during 
the second round as a sheet of fire no more 
than 60 feet high that does 6d6 damage 
(Reflex DC 24 negates) to any creature that 
passes through it. On the third round, the line 
of magma cools to a thin layer of brittle stone 
that quickly degrades to powder and sand over the course 

of several hours; magma that’s turned to a sheet of fire is 
consumed entirely during the second round, leaving behind 
only a stain of smoke in the air that swiftly disperses. The 
save DC is Constitution-based.
Death Curse (Su) When a creature slays a crag linnorm, the 
slayer is affected by the curse of fire. 
Curse of Fire: save Will DC 22; effect creature gains 
vulnerability to fire. The save DC is Charisma-based.
freedom of Movement (Ex) A crag linnorm is under the 
constant effect of freedom of movement, as per the spell of 
the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
Poison (Su) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 
10 rounds; effect 2d6 fire damage and 1d4 Con drain; cure 2 
consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
True Seeing (Ex) A crag linnorm has constant true seeing, as

Like all linnorms, the deadly crag linnorm is a powerful, 
primeval dragon, a denizen of the wild regions far north of 
where most civilizations dare to tread. The crag linnorm 
is among the weakest of its kind, yet still a devastating 
predator in its own right. Favored, if not by the gods, 
then by some primal intelligence of the mysterious world 
of the fey, the linnorm bestows a powerful curse on any 
who manage to slay it. A crag linnorm is 60 feet long and 
weighs 12,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard 
action, an ice linnorm can expel a 60-foot cone of freezing, 
viscous ooze, dealing 18d8 points of cold damage to all 
creatures struck (Reflex DC 28 halves). The freezing ooze 
clings to those struck, and 1 round later the ooze 
hardens into thick sheets of ice. Creatures that 
were damaged are frozen motionless unless they 
can break free with a DC 25 Strength, Escape Artist, 
or combat maneuver check.  Each round a creature 
remains frozen it takes 1d6 points of cold damage. 
Another creature can free a frozen target by tearing 
away the ice (this takes 1d4 rounds) or dealing at 
least 20 points of fire damage to the frozen target. Left 
unattended, the ice crumbles away in 2d4 rounds on its 
own. Creatures with the fire subtype cannot be frozen in 

place by this breath weapon. Flying creatures that don’t have 
supernatural flight fall if frozen, and swimming creatures that 
are frozen rise toward the surface of the water at a speed of 
60 feetper round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Death Curse (Su) When a creature slays an ice linnorm, the 
slayer is affected by the curse of frost. 
Curse of Frost: save Will DC 25; effect creature gains 
vulnerability to cold. The save DC is Charisma-based.
freedom of Movement (Ex) An ice linnorm is under the 
constant effect of freedom of movement, as per the spell of 
the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
Poison (Su) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 
10 rounds; effect 4d6 cold damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 3 
consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
True Seeing (Ex) An ice linnorm has true seeing, as the spell of 
the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses and atop 
wind-blasted mountain peaks—tales speak of climbers 
unwittingly clambering over the flanks of a particularly 
immense ice linnorm coiled around a mountain, only to 
find death at its furious fangs and claws at the summit of 
their goal. During the fiercest winters, ice linnorms are 
said to slither down to the lowlands to eat entire villages.
An ice linnorm is 90 feet long and 
weighs 18,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
All-Around Vision (Ex) A tarn linnorm’s two heads grant it a 
+8 racial bonus on Perception checks. It cannot be flanked.
Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard 
action, a tarn linnorm can expel a 120-foot line or a 60-foot 
cone of acid, dealing 22d8 points of acid damage to all 
creatures struck (Reflex DC 32 halves). This acid creates 
toxic fumes when it consumes organic material—on the 
round after a creature takes acid damage from this 
attack, it must make a DC 32 Fortitude save or take 
2d6 points of Strength damage from the poisonous 
fumes (this secondary effect is a poison effect). As a 
full-round action, the linnorm may breathe acid with 
one head and bite with the other (but not use its other 
weapons). Alternatively, as a full-round action, it can 

breathe acid from both heads to create two adjacent 60-foot-
long cones or two separate 120-foot-long lines. In this case it 
cannot use its breath weapon again for 2d4 rounds. The save 
DC is Constitution-based.
Death Curse (Su) When a creature slays a tarn linnorm, the 
slayer is affected by the curse of death. 
Curse of Death: save Will DC 29; effect creature can no longer 
be affected by healing spells and does not heal damage 
naturally from rest. The save DC is Charisma-based.
freedom of Movement (Ex) A tarn linnorm is under the 
constant effect of freedom of movement, as the spell of the 
same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
Poison (Su) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 
10 rounds; effect 6d6 acid damage and 1d8 Con drain; cure 3 
consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitutuion-based.
True Seeing (Ex) A tarn linnorm has true seeing, as the spell of 
the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
Although legends speak of even more powerful linnorms, it’s 
hard to believe after witnessing the devastation a two-headed 
tarn linnorm can wreak. Content to slumber away the centuries 
at the bottom of dark mountain lakes, the tarn linnorms are 
true horrors that even the mightiest of heroes fear.
A tarn linnorm is 120 feet long and weighs 24,000 
pounds.

Male lions are 5 to 8 feet long and weigh 330 to 550 
pounds. Females are slightly smaller but use 
the same statistics.
Lions are usually the top animal 
predators in their territories, though 
they resort to scavenging if 
convenient or necessary. They 
may kill other predators 
(such as leopards and 
hyenas) that encroach upon 
their haunts, but rarely 
eat these kills unless game 
is scarce. Most lions do not 
selectively hunt humanoids, 
but occasionally one learns 
what easy kills they are and 
becomes a man-eater. 
Lions prefer plains but 
can adapt to living in 
shallow caves as long 
as there’s a large and 
stable supply of prey to 
keep them fed.

Dire lions, known locally as spotted 
lions or cave lions, are immense 
predators that can grow 
up to 15 feet long and 
weigh up to 3,500 
pounds. Although they 
are merely animals, 
these large creatures 
seem to take an 
almost sadistic glee 
in playing with 
and tormenting 
their prey before 
eventually devouring 
it. As a result, many 
tribes view dire 
lions as the spawn 
of evil gods, and 
hunt them down 
as soon as their 
presence in a region 
becomes obvious.

Intimidating Charge (Ex) When a giant frilled lizard charges, it

to the normal effects of a

must make a DC 13

but might have other special attacks 
like grab, trip, constrict (with a bite), 
or pounce.

This immense lizard moves with a slow but relentless gait. Its feet 
end in large talons, and ropes of drool hang from its toothy maw.

This bright-eyed lizard is larger than a horse. As it hisses in anger, 
a brightly colored frill extends around its neck.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
hold Breath (Ex) A lizardfolk can hold its breath for a number 
of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it 
risks drowning.
Lizardfolk are proud and powerful reptilian predators 
that make their communal homes in scattered villages 
deep within swamps and marshes. Uninterested in 
colonization of the dry lands and content with the simple 
weapons and rituals that have served them well for 
millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by many other races as 
backwater savages, but within their isolated communities 
lizardfolk are actually a vibrant people filled with 
tradition and an oral history stretching back to before 
humans walked upright.
Most lizardfolk stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 
250 pounds, their powerful muscles covered in scales of 
gray, green, or brown. Some breeds have short dorsal 
spikes or brightly colored frills, and all swim 
well by moving with f licks of their powerful 
4-foot-long tails. While completely at home in 

the water, they breathe air and return to their clustered 
mound-dwellings to breed and sleep. As their reptilian 
blood makes them sluggish in the cold, most lizardfolk 
hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes 
at night to curl up with other tribesmen in the shared 
warmth of large peat fires.
Though generally neutral, lizardfolks’ standoffish 
demeanor, staunch rejection of civilization’s “gifts,” 
and legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be viewed 
negatively by most humanoids. These traits stem 
from good reasons, however, as their own slow rate of 
reproduction is no match for warm-blooded humanoids, 
and those tribes who don’t defend their wetland territories 
to the last breath quickly find themselves overwhelmed 
by the mammalian hordes. As for their tendency to 
consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, 
the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is 
hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste.
The lizardfolk presented here dwell in a swampy 
environment. Lizardfolk tribes can exist in other 
environments as well, but they lose their swim 
speed and instead 
gain a climb speed 
of 15 feet.

This reptilian humanoid has green scales, a short and toothy 
snout, and a thick alligator-like tail.

Lycanthrope
Lycanthropes are humanoids with the ability to turn into 
animals and animal-humanoid hybrid shapes. Natural 
lycanthropes are born with this ability and have perfect 
control over their shapechanging. Aff licted lycanthropes 
contract this ability like a curse or disease from another 
lycanthrope; they sometimes change form involuntarily.
Creating a Lycanthrope
“Lycanthrope” is an inherited (for natural lycanthropes) 
or acquired (for aff licted lycanthropes) template that can 
be added to any humanoid.
Challenge Rating: Same as base creature or base animal 
(whichever is higher) + 1.
Size and Type: The creature (referred to hereafter as 
the base creature) gains the shapechanger subtype. The 
lycanthrope takes on the characteristics of some type 
of animal (referred to hereafter as the base animal) 
within one size category of the base creature’s size. A 
lycanthrope’s hybrid form is the same size as the base 
animal or the base creature, whichever is larger.
AC: In hybrid or animal form the lycanthrope has the 
natural armor bonus of the base animal increased by +2.
Defensive Abilities: A natural lycanthrope gains DR 10/
silver in animal or hybrid form. An aff licted lycanthrope 
gains DR 5/silver in animal or hybrid form.
Speed: Same as the base creature or base animal, 
depending on which form the lycanthrope is using. 
Hybrids use the base creature’s speed.
Melee: A lycanthrope gains natural attacks in animal 
and hybrid forms according to the base animal.
Special Attacks: A lycanthrope retains all the special 
attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base creature. 
In hybrid or animal form it gains the special attacks, 
qualities, and abilities of the base animal. A lycanthrope 
also gains low-light vision, scent, and the following:
Change Shape (Su) All lycanthropes have three forms—a 
humanoid form, an animal form, and a hybrid form. 
Equipment does not meld with the new form between 
humanoid and hybrid form, but does between those forms 
and animal form. A natural lycanthrope can shift to any of 
its three alternate forms as a move-equivalent action. An 
afflicted lycanthrope can assume animal or hybrid form as 
a full-round action by making a DC 15 Constitution check, 
or humanoid form as a full-round action by making a DC 
20 Constitution check. On nights when the full moon is 
visible, an afflicted lycanthrope gains a +5 morale bonus to 
Constitution checks made to assume animal or hybrid form, 
but a –5 penalty to Constitution checks made to assume 
humanoid form. An afflicted lycanthrope reverts to its 
humanoid form automatically with the next sunrise, or after 
8 hours of rest, whichever comes first. A slain lycanthrope 

reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead. For 
additional rules on this supernatural ability, see page 298.
Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) A natural lycanthrope’s bite 
attack in animal or hybrid form infects a humanoid target 
with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the victim’s 
size is not within one size category of the lycanthrope, 
this ability has no effect.
Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex) In any form, natural lycanthropes 
can communicate and empathize with animals related to 
their animal form. They can use Diplomacy to alter such 
an animal’s attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial 
bonus on the check. Aff licted lycanthropes only gain this 
ability in animal or hybrid form.
Ability Scores: +2 Wis, –2 Cha in all forms; +2 Str, +2 Con 
in hybrid and animal forms. Lycanthropes have enhanced 
senses but are not fully in control of their emotions and 
animalistic urges. In addition to these adjustments to the 
base creature’s stats, a lycanthrope’s ability scores change 
when he assumes hybrid or animal form. In human form, 
the lycanthrope’s ability scores are unchanged from the base 
creature’s form. In animal and hybrid form, the lycanthrope’s 
ability scores are the same as the base creature’s or the base 
animal’s, whichever ability score is higher.
Lycanthropy
A creature that catches lycanthropy becomes an aff licted 
lycanthrope, but shows no symptoms (and does not gain 
any of the template’s adjustments or abilities) until the 
night of the next full moon, when the victim involuntarily 
assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity. 
The character remains in animal form until the next 
dawn and remembers nothing about the entire episode (or 
subsequent episodes) unless he makes a DC 20 Will save, in 
which case he becomes aware of his condition.
A remove disease or heal spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or 
higher cures the aff liction, provided the character receives 
the spell within 3 days of the infecting lycanthrope’s attack. 
Alternatively, consuming a dose of wolfsbane (Pathfinder 
RPG Core Rulebook 560) gives an aff licted lycanthrope a 
new Fortitude save to recover from lycanthropy.

Lycanthropic Player Characters
When a PC becomes a lycanthrope, you as the GM have a choice 
to make. In most cases, you should take control of the PC’s 
actions whenever he is in hybrid or animal form—lycanthropy 
shouldn’t be a method to increase a PC’s power, after all, and 
what an afflicted lycanthrope does while in animal or hybrid 
form is often at odds with what the character would actually 
want. If a player wants to play a lycanthrope, he should play a 
natural lycanthrope and follow the guidelines on page 313 for 
playing a character of a powerful race.

Natural wererats tend to be short and wiry, with constantly 
darting eyes and frequent nervous twitches. Males often 
have thin, ragged moustaches.
Wererats prefer cities where they can blend in with the 
humanoid and rat population. Their abilities make them 
especially good at thieving and spying, and in many cities 
the thieves’ guild employs numerous wererat members.

This hunched creature looks like a human in studded leather, but 
fur covers its body. Its face is rat-like, and it has a long, naked tail.

In their humanoid form, werewolves look like normal 
people, though some tend to look a bit feral and have 
wild hair. Eyebrows that grow together, index fingers 
longer than the middle fingers, and strange birthmarks 
on the palm of the hand are all commonly accepted 
indications that a person is in fact a werewolf. Of 
course, such telltale signs are not always accurate, for 
such physical traits exist in normal people as well, but 
in areas where werewolves are a common problem, the 
traits can be damning regardless.
Of all the various types of lycanthropes, it is the 
werewolf that is the most widespread and the most 
feared. Stories of werewolves haunting lonely forest 
roads, prowling misty moors on the outskirts of rural 
societies, or dwelling in the shadows of the largest cities 
are widespread as well. In most societies, werewolves 
are feared and despised—and with good reason, as the 
typical werewolf personifies all that is savage 
and bestial in a lycanthrope. This isn’t to 
say that good-aligned werewolves are 
unknown, but they’re certainly 
a minority among their kind, 
and most werewolves are evil 
murderers who delight in 
the hunt and the succulent 
taste of raw meat.
Just as wolves 
are pack animals, 
werewolves have 
been known to 
gather in colonies 
and live among their own 
kind, humanoid by day 
and beast at night. Visitors 
to werewolf villages are 
generally rushed out of 
town before nightfall so as 
not to discover the citizenry’s 
dark secret—unless, of 
course, the pack 
decides that 
the unlucky 
visitor  won’t 
be missed 
by friends 
back home.

This muscular creature has a man’s body but the snarling head 
and fur coat of a wolf.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spikes (Ex) With a snap of its tail, a manticore can 
loose a volley of four spikes as a standard action (make 
an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 
feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 
30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only 24 
spikes in any 24-hour period.
Manticores are fierce predators that patrol a 
wide area in search of fresh meat. A typical 
manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 
1,000 pounds. Some have more human-like 
heads, usually with beards. Males and females 
look much alike.
Manticores eat any meat, even carrion, though 
they prefer human f lesh and rarely pass up an 
opportunity for such a delicacy. They are smart and 
social enough to bargain with or bully evil humanoids 
into alliances or offering tribute, and more 
powerful creatures may hire or bribe them 
to guard or patrol a place or area. They 
like lairs in high places, such as 
hilltops and caves in cliffs.

Although manticores were likely a magical creation, 
they have long since established themselves as a naturally 
occurring species. Curiously, manticores seem strangely 
fecund, and can interbreed with a number of other 
similarly shaped creatures, including lions, dire lions, 
lamias, sphinxes, and even chimeras. The progeny of a 
manticore and an unusual mate is summarized on the 
table below.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Lunge (Ex) A giant mantis’s limbs are 
capable of reaching much farther than 
normal for a creature of its size. As a full-
attack action, it can make a single attack with 
its claws at double its normal reach. When a giant 
mantis attacks with a claw in this manner, it gains 
a +4 bonus on its attack roll. A giant mantis cannot 
make attacks of opportunity with its lunge.
Mandibles (Ex) A giant mantis that grabs a foe can 
make a bite attack against that foe as a 
secondary attack. The mantis’s bite is a +0 
attack that inflicts 1d6+1 points of damage 
on a hit.
Sudden Strike (Ex) A giant mantis is 
particularly adept at moving quickly 
when its foes are surprised. During a 
surprise round, a giant mantis may act 
as if it had a full round to act, rather than 
just one standard action. 
Known to many as the giant praying 
mantis for the way the creature’s deadly 
front limbs fold under its head as it lies 

in wait for food, this creature is well feared along caravan 
tracks that pass through dense woodlands. The giant 
mantis, a master of hiding in dense undergrowth, is 
almost unnaturally patient as it lies in wait, striking with 
unsettling speed as unsuspecting meals wander by.
In many savage societies, the giant mantis is particularly 
feared—in regions where these vermin are common, they 
are often regarded as messengers of death sent to the world 
by angry gods. Their swift speed, alien appearance, and 
near-invisibility in forests give rise to many legends—
that the giant mantis can become invisible, that it can 
smell fear, and that the souls of those who it slays and eats 
are digested and kept from moving on to the afterlife. 
While the giant mantis is nothing more than an efficient 
and deadly vermin, the numerous legends and whispers 
regarding its supposed powers and alien intellect 
have inspired some spellcasters to work such features 
into their constructs as a way to make them even more 
fearsome. There are even stories of entire societies of 
assassins who worship an immense mantis as a god, and 
who have taken to heart the mantis’s style of murderous 
ambush, fighting with twin serrated rapiers.
The giant mantis presented here stands 7 feet tall 
and 15 feet long, and weighs 650 pounds. Larger giant 
mantises exist in the deepest, darkest forests of the world, 
where they might prey upon things as mighty as giants 
or dragons. Known by various names, such as the drake-
eating mantis, the treebender mantis, or simply the deadly 
mantis, these immense behemoths average more than 60 
feet in height and have a terrifying habit of destroying 
entire villages or towns in order to satiate their ravenous 
appetites. A deadly mantis is a giant mantis advanced to 
Colossal size, 16 Hit Dice, and CR 14.

This towering insect walks on its back four legs. Its head is 
triangular and its front legs sport razor-sharp edges and claws.

Medusas are human-like creatures with snakes instead 
of hair. At distances of 30 feet or more, a medusa can 
easily pass for a beautiful woman if she wears something 
to cover her serpentine locks—when wearing clothing 
that conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for 
a human at even closer distances. Medusas use lies and 
disguises that conceal their faces to get close enough 
to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they 
like playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a 
distance to lead enemies into traps. Some enjoy creating 
intricate decorations out of their victims, using their 
petrified remains as accents to their swampy lairs, but 
most medusas take care to hide the evidence of their 
previous conf licts so that new foes won’t have advance 
warning of their presence.
Used to concealing themselves, medusas in cities 
are usually rogues, while those in the wilderness often 
pass themselves off as rangers or trackers. The most 
notorious and legendary medusas, though, 
are those who take levels as bards or 
clerics. Charismatic and intelligent, urban 
medusas are often involved with 
thieves’ guilds or other aspects of the 
criminal underworld. Medusas may 
form alliances with blind creatures or 
intelligent undead, both of which are 
immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting 
medusas often serve as oracles or 
prophets, usually dwelling in remote 
locations of legendary power 
or infamous history. Such 
oracle medusas take great 
delight in their roles, 
and if presented with the 
proper gifts and flattery, the 
secrets they offer can be quite 
helpful. Of course, the lairs 
of such potent creatures are 
liberally decorated with statues 
of those who have offended them, so 
the seeker of knowledge is well advised to 
tred carefully during such meetings.
All known medusas are female. Rarely, a 
medusa may decide to keep a male humanoid 
as a mate, usually with the help of elixirs of love 
or similar magic, and is always careful to not 
petrify her prisoner—at least until she grows 
tired of his company.

This slender, attractive woman has strangely glowing eyes and a 
full head of hissing snakes for hair.

From the waist up, merfolk bear the torsos of well-built 
humans and delicate features reminiscent of elves and 
other humanoids tied to the natural world. A merfolk’s 
lower body consists of the fins and tail of a great fish. 
Depending on the region, the scales of merfolk vary in 
hue, including gleaming silver, pale green, or even blue 
with stripes of yellow and crimson. Merfolk typically 
measure 6 to 8 feet in length and weigh over 200 pounds, 
with females being slightly smaller than males. 
Although amphibious, merfolk move only 
with difficulty on land and rarely wander 
more than a mile from sea.
It is quite rare for a 
merfolk to make 
contact with a 
creature not of 
its kind. In 
fact, many 

go to great lengths to steer sailors away from their lands, 
even resorting to violence if necessary. Ancient accounts 
hint at merfolk protecting a terrible secret bound to the 
depths, and though no reports mention what this secret 
is, the lengths merfolk go to remain isolated from other 
races highlight the importance of this safeguard.
While merfolk outwardly appear to be a beautiful and 
powerful race, some sages and seafarers whisper that 
degenerate and mutated merfolk roam the deepest, most 
isolated regions of the seas and oceans. Some evidence 
states that this offshoot fell to the worship of twisted and 
sinister powers lurking in the darkness below, while other 
theories include all merfolk in this sinister agenda, holding 
that even those merfolk who believe they control their 
own destinies are, in fact, merely unknowing puppets of a 
sinister and unknown master race deep under the sea.
Merfolk Characters
Merfolk are defined by their class levels—they do not 
possess racial Hit Dice. All merfolk have the following 
racial traits.
+2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma: Merfolk 
are graceful, hale, and beautiful.
Aquatic: Merfolk are aquatic and can breathe water. 
Their land speed is 5 feet, but their swim speed is 50 
feet. They are amphibious, but prefer not to spend long 
periods out of the water.
Low-Light Vision: All merfolk have low-light vision.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Adhesive (Ex) A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as 
a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or 
items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic 
automatically grapples any creature it hits with 
its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get 
free while the mimic is alive without removing the 
adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesive-
coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder 
succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A successful DC 
17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck 
weapon. Strong alcohol or universal solvent 
dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic can still 
grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its 
adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 
5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is 
Strength-based.
Mimic Object (Ex) A mimic can assume the general 
shape of any Medium object, such as a massive 
chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot 
substantially alter its size, though. A mimic’s body is hard 

and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance 
it might present. A mimic gains a +20 racial bonus on 
Disguise checks when imitating an object in this manner. 
Disguise is always a class skill for a mimic.
Mimics are thought to be the result of an alchemist’s 
attempt to grant life to an inanimate object through the 
application of an eldritch reagent, the recipe for which 
is long lost. Over time, these strange but clever creatures 
have learned the ability to transform themselves 
into simulacra of man-made objects, particularly in 
locations that have infrequent traffic by small numbers 
of creatures, thus increasing their odds of successfully 
attacking their victims.  
Though mimics are not inherently evil, some sages 
believe that mimics attack humans and other intelligent 
creatures for sport rather than merely for sustenance. 
The desire to completely fool others is thought to be a 
part of their being, and their surprise attacks against 
others are a culmination of those desires. 
A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet 
by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 900 pounds. Legends 
and tales speak of mimics of much greater sizes, with 
the ability to assume the form of houses, ships, or entire 
dungeon complexes that they festoon with treasure (both 
real and false) to lure unsuspecting food within.

What appeared to be a chest filled with treasure comes to life as it 
grows long, glistening tentacles and a number of sharp teeth.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
natural Cunning (Ex) Although minotaurs are not 
especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and 
logical ability. This gives them immunity to maze spells 
and prevents them from ever becoming lost. Further, 
they are never caught flat-footed.
Nothing holds a grudge like a minotaur. Scorned 
by the civilized races centuries ago and born from 
a deific curse, minotaurs have hunted, slain, and 
devoured lesser humanoids in retribution for real or 
imagined slights for as long as anyone can remember. 
Many cultures have legends of how the first minotaurs 
were created by vengeful or slighted gods who 
punished humans by twisting their forms, 
robbing them of their intellects and beauty, and 
giving them the heads of bulls. Yet most modern 
minotaurs hold these legends in contempt and 
believe that they are not divine mockeries but divine 
paragons created by a potent and cruel demon lord 
named Baphomet.
The traditional minotaur’s lair is a maze, be it a legitimate 
labyrinth constructed to baff le and confuse, an accidental 

one such as a city sewer system, or a naturally occurring 
one such as a tangle of caverns and other underground 
passageways. Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs 
use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them 
out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, 
slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way 
out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur 
move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a 
group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread 
the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of 
slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be 
heroes make for delicious meals.
Minotaurs might also be found in the employ of a more 
powerful monster or evil creature, serving it so long 
as they can still hunt and dine as they please. Usually 
this means guarding some powerful object or valuable 
location, but it can also be a sort of mercenary work, 
hunting down the foes of its master.
Minotaurs are relatively straightforward combatants, 
using their horns to horribly gore the nearest living 
creature when combat begins.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
hatred (Ex) Mites receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against 
humanoid creatures of the dwarf or gnome subtype due to 
special training against these hated foes.
Vermin Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid’s 
wild empathy, save that a mite can only use this ability 
on vermin. A mite gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. 
Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic 
communication imparts on them a modicum of 
implanted intelligence, allowing mites to train 
Medium vermin and use them as mounts. Vermin 
empathy treats swarms as if they were one 
creature possessing a single mind—a mite can 
thus use this ability to influence and direct the 
actions of swarms with relative ease. 

Descended from even smaller fey, the mites are among 
the most pitiful and craven dwellers of the dark. 
Hideously ugly, even goblins have been known to mock 
mites for their homely appearances, mockery most mites 
take to heart and nurture for weeks, months, or even 
years in their tiny homes, until their distress and anger 
finally overcome their natural cowardice and impel them 
forth on short-lived bouts of bloody vengeance from the 
doubtful safety of a spider’s back.
Mites, once closer to the strange realm of the fey, have 
grown larger and stockier after countless generations 
spent on the Material Plane. Yet still, their stature places 
them at the bottom of the pile in the dangerous caverns 
in which they live. Their traditional enemies are dwarves 
and gnomes, particularly the svirfneblin of the deep 
underground caves. The one thing that gives them a 
significant edge over an enemy in a fight is their natural 
ability to empathize with normally mindless vermin—
mites are particularly fond of spiders, centipedes, and cave 
fishers, and a mite colony usually has a few of these far 
more dangerous monsters on hand to defend the group.
Although they have lost the supernatural ability to 
tinker with magic items, luck, or mechanical objects 
possessed by their more sinister and dangerous gremlin 
kin, mites retain the ability to perform minor magical 
tricks with prestidigitation, and often use these tricks to 
annoy their enemies. When faced with dangerous foes, a 
mite uses its doom ability to hex a foe—a mite’s eyes bulge 
hideously open when it uses this spell-like ability.
A mite is 3 feet tall and weighs 40 pounds.

This squat humanoid seems to be nearly all head—an unfortunate 
circumstance, considering how ugly its puffy blue face is.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create Spawn (Su) Humanoid 
creatures killed by a mohrg 
rise immediately as fast 
zombies under the mohrg’s 
control. The sudden bloom of 
unlife when a mohrg’s victim dies 
and becomes a zombie causes 
a surge of negative energy to 
flow through the mohrg. Whenever 
a mohrg creates a zombie in this 
manner, it is healed 1d6 hit points 
per HD possessed by the slain 
creature and acts as if hasted for 
the round immediately following 
the spawn’s creation.
Those who slay many over the course 
of their lifetimes, be they serial killers, 
mass-murderers, warmongering soldiers, or 

battle-driven berserkers, become marked and tainted by 
the sheer weight of their murderous deeds. When such 
killers are brought to justice and publicly executed for 
their heinous crimes before they have a chance to atone, 
the remains sometimes return to unlife to continue their 
dark work as a mohrg.
Undead things caring less for life than they did before 
their own deaths, mohrgs exist solely to wreak havoc on 
the living. Sometimes mistaken for skeletons or zombies, 
they are far more dangerous than those mindless 
abominations, retaining some semblance of their own 
memories—and the delight they once took in hearing the 
screams of the dying.
When possible, mohrgs gather in small groups, 
seeking out lone targets much as they did in life. If faced 
with capable foes, a mohrg attempts to incapacitate them 
one by one, starting with divinely empowered characters 
first, both to protect itself from holy wrath, and to make 
the task of paralyzing and devouring the others that 
much easier.
Some mohrgs retain enough of their former 
memories that they return to the favored locations 
of their pasts, “haunting” old hideouts and 
sometimes even resuming the depredations 
of murderers long dead, falling back on 
means of death and mayhem that were 
more comfortable in their breathing days. 
Such mohrgs are even more insane than most 
undead beings, and can sometimes be found 
wandering the streets of a city or town 
in cowls and cloaks, carrying on 
their old life’s work of slaughter and 
murder as best they can.
Of course, since those slain by 
a mohrg rise soon thereafter 
as undead themselves, the 
murders of a mohrg do not 
go unnoticed for long, even 
when they take extra care to 
prey only upon society’s dregs. 
A sudden uprising of undead in 
the streets is the inevitable result 
of a mohrg’s attentions. Since these zombies remain 
under the mohrg’s control, and since the mohrg 
itself possesses a hateful and cruel intelligence, it 
often holds its undead army in reserve, even 
commanding it to lie motionless until 
several weeks or months have passed and 
the local graveyard is filled with 
the sleeping dead. Then, when the 
time is right, the mohrg calls 
upon its army to rise and aid it 
in finishing the slaughter.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Expert Climber (Ex) A morlock can cling to cave 
walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has 
hand- and footholds. In effect, a morlock is treated 
as constantly being under a nonmagical version of 
the spell spider climb, save that it cannot cling to smooth 
surfaces. This ability doubles the normal +8 racial bonus 
to Climb checks normally afforded creatures with a climb 
speed to a +16 racial bonus.
Leap Attack (Ex) As a standard action, a morlock may make a 
single attack during a jump. It can make this attack at any point 
along the course of the leap—the start, the end, or while in 
mid-air. While jumping, a morlock does not provoke attacks of 
opportunity for leaving a threatened square.
Swarming (Ex) Morlocks dwell and fight in cramped quarters 
every day of their lives, and as such are quite adept at 
swarming foes. Up to two morlocks can share the same 
square at the same time. If two morlocks in the same 
square attack the same foe, they are considered to be 
flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.

Morlock
Skin pale as a slug’s belly, eyes huge and bulging, this thing crawls 
down the wall like a spider, but its shape is hideously humanoid. 

MMoohhrrgg––MMoorrlloocckk

Degenerate humans long lost from the world of light, 
morlocks have regressed through years of subterranean 
dwelling into ravenous, barely thinking beasts of the 
endless night. They no longer remember the civilized 
lives their ancestors led, although many morlock tribes 
still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient homes. 
Ironically, in many cases morlocks worship the statues 
left behind by these ancestors as their gods. Morlock 
priests of such ancestor worship have access to the 
domains of Darkness, Earth, Madness, and Strength. A 
typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs 
roughly 150 pounds.
Morlocks move about on two legs at times, but often drop 
down to a creepy four-limbed shuff le when speed or stealth 
is necessary. Their wiry, often emaciated frames mask the 
strength of their limbs and their swift reactions. 
Morlocks typically give birth to broods of three to four 
babies at a time, ravenous creatures born with a full set 
of teeth and a cannibalistic predisposition. The first few 
weeks of a brood’s life must be carefully mothered to prevent 
attrition—it usually takes that long for the morlock young 
to overcome their natural inclination to feed on whatever 
is closest. Morlocks mature quickly, achieving adulthood 
after only 5 years of life. A typical morlock can live to a ripe 
old age of 60—although the majority of their kind die far 
sooner than that due to violence.

Despair (Su) All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see 
a mummy must make a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed 
by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is 
successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the 
same mummy’s despair ability for 24 hours. This is a 
paralysis and a mind-affecting fear affect. The save DC is 
Charisma-based.
Mummy Rot (Su) Curse and disease—slam; save Fort DC 
16; onset 1 minute; frequency 1 day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 
Cha; cure —. Mummy rot is both a curse and disease and 
can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which 
point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the 
curse element of mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering 
from it cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting 
a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted creature 
must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell 
is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies 
from mummy rot turns to dust and cannot be raised 
without a resurrection or greater magic. The save DC is 
Charisma-based.

Created to guard the tombs of the honored dead, 
mummies are ever vigilant for those who would desecrate 
their sacred ground.
Mummies are created through a rather lengthy and 
gruesome embalming process, during which all of the 
body’s major organs are removed and replaced with dried 
herbs and f lowers. After this process, the f lesh is anointed 
with sacred oils and wrapped in purified linens. The 
creator then finishes the ritual with a create undead spell.
Although most mummies are created merely as 
guardians and remain loyal to their charge until their 
destruction, certain powerful mummies have much more 
free will. The majority are at least 10th-level clerics, and 
are often kings or pharaohs who have called upon dark 
gods or sinister necromancers to bind their souls to their 
bodies after death—usually as a means to extend their rule 
beyond the grave, but at times simply to escape what they 
fear will be an eternity of torment in their own afterlife.

Wrapped from head to toe in ancient strips of moldering linen, 
this humanoid moves with a shuff ling gait.

Dark nagas covet luxury, wealth, and power over others. 
With bodies covered by shimmering, eel-like black 
scales, dark nagas slither deftly through forsaken lands 
and abandoned ruins, scouring such places for treasures 
and weaker creatures they might force into service. Their 
forked tongues spread only lies, and others whom they 
can’t manipulate they destroy with their insidious poison 
and destructive magical abilities. A typical dark naga 
measures approximately 12 feet long and weighs upward 
of 300 pounds.
Arrogant and sybaritic, dark nagas seek to dominate 
lesser creatures, relishing the fear they inspire and power 
over other beings. While some manage to carve indulgent 
fiefdoms from tribes of goblins, orcs, lizardfolk, or other 
barbarous races, the luster of cosmopolitan fineries proves 
enticing as well, leading some to infiltrate city sewers and 
slums to gather an urban following. They particularly 
relish morbidly crafted jewelry and treasures, often 
adorning themselves with jeweled bands or taking their 
ease atop piles of treasure.
Dark nagas hate others of their kind, especially other 
dark nagas, seeing their brethren as deadly opponents to 
be dispatched swiftly and mercilessly—often rightly so.

A sharp-featured humanoid head crowns the powerful, sinuous 
body of this snake-like monstrosity.

this attack must make successful saves (see above) to 
avoid the effect.

Although ferocious in shape, with radiant scales, cobra-
like hoods, and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian 
nagas serve as dutiful protectors of places of fundamental 
power and sanctity. Their scales often bear elaborate 
patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A 
typical guardian naga stretches 14 feet long and weighs 
approximately 350 pounds.
While many guardian nagas adhere to the exotic 
practices of ancient or forgotten faiths, others are merely 
drawn to sites of innate wonder—towering waterfalls, 
natural spires, mountaintop temples—minding them 
out of their own senses of duty and reverence. Often 
these nagas join a living faith, serving as protectors of 
sanctuaries or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas might 
take up residence near a site they deem worthy of 
protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring 
there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the 
choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to 
protect their elder’s charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga 
protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector 
in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries. Such 
sentinels often take the same name as their forebears to 
appear as a single, exceptionally long-lived figure.

A contemplative humanoid face framed by a cobra-like hood 
adorns the body of this long, brightly colored serpent.

Spells A spirit naga casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer, 
and can cast spells from the cleric list as 
well as those normally available to a 
sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered 
arcane spells for a spirit naga.
Morbid-minded and wretched to look 
upon, spirit nagas are the witches of the 
naga race, hateful outcasts long shunned for 

their dark powers and loathsome ways. A typical spirit 
naga is slender, with the scales of a venomous serpent 
and a tangle of greasy hair framing their pale faces. Most 
measure 14 feet long but weigh less than 300 pounds.
Spirit nagas delight in places of death and desolation. 
Battle-scarred ruins, untended graveyards, despoiled 
forests, and tangled swamps all attract these repulsive 
creatures. Where guardian nagas favor places of innate 
sanctity, spirit nagas seek out places of fundamental 
corruption, sites they believe to be imbued with dark 
magics. The crypts of long-dead tyrants, the death places 
of great heroes, and the ruins of nefarious keeps all attract 
these wretched serpents.
Most spirit nagas believe themselves to be the 
inheritors of some mysterious dark favor, seeing 
their innate magical talents as evidence of such. Most 
commune with vague powers of death and devastation, 
working profane rights and seeking grotesque auguries 
from cultic forces. To aid them, spirit nagas often use 
their enchanting gaze, changing victims into fawning 
fanatics and would-be sacrifices.
Spirit nagas occasionally band together in small 
groups—some seeming to mimic the covens of hags. 
While a particular plot or 
foe might bring these deadly 
serpents together for a short 
time, spirit nagas are loyal only 
to themselves, and such alliances 
always end in deadly betrayal.

Yellowed, venom-dripping fangs fill the human-like mouth of this 
sinister serpentine monstrosity.

Mind Thrust (Su) As a standard action up to 
three times a day, a neothelid can 
deliver a massive blast of mental 

energy at any one target within 60 feet, inflicting 15d10 points 
of damage. A successful DC 25 Will save negates the effect. This 
effect can only harm creatures with Intelligence scores. This is a 
mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Psychic Crush (Su) As a standard action up to three times a 
day, a neothelid can attempt to crush the mind of a single 
creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 25 
Will save or collapse, becoming unconscious and dying at 
–1 hit points. If the target succeeds on the save, it takes 
6d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 round. This is a 
mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Trace Teleport (Ex) A neothelid telepathically and reflexively 
learns the mental coordinates of the destination, of all 
creatures that teleport within 60 feet of it, gaining an 
awareness of the location equivalent to “seen casually.” 
This knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This power 
does not grant any environmental information about the 
conditions of the destination.
Dwelling only in the deepest reaches of the underworld, 
the immense neothelids once ruled empires in the 
depths, yet their numbers have been vastly reduced as 
other races have proven swifter to breed and adapt. Today, 
the neothelid is a legend, the subject of tales of horror 
among those few to have experienced the creature’s wrath 
in person and lived to tell about it.
Neothelids are served by all manner of strange worm-
like creatures, minions they use to observe and wage war 
against their enemies. The neothelids themselves were 
spawned by even more horrific entities, ageless horrors 
from strange dimensions beyond the edge of known 
reality—the neothelids see themselves as the 
chosen agents of these malevolent forces, working 
to ready the world for their return.

Its slime-drenched length coiled upon itself in a shuddering 
mountain, this huge worm’s tentacled head rises like a snake’s.

immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con damage (target must 
save a 2nd time or 1 point of the damage is drain instead); cure 2 
consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Dream haunting (Su) A night hag can visit the dreams of chaotic 
or evil targets by using a special periapt known as a 
heartstone to become ethereal, then hovering over 
the creature. Once it does so, it rides on the victim’s 
back until dawn. The sleeper suffers tormenting 
dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain 
upon awakening. Only another ethereal 
being can stop these nocturnal intrusions 
by confronting and defeating the night hag.

heartstone (Su) All night hags carry a heartstone—a special 
gemstone worth at least 1,800 gp that is worn as a periapt. 
A heartstone’s magic is fueled by the hag’s spirit and 
proximity—once separated from its owner (or upon the hag’s 
death), a heartstone retains its magic for only 24 hours before 
becoming a nonmagical gem again. The heartstone instantly 
cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a 
heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving 
throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block above). A 
night hag that loses this charm can no longer use etherealness 
or soul bind until it finds a replacement gemstone.
Terrifying murderesses and greedy soul brokers, night 
hags prey upon mortals while they’re most vulnerable. 
Preferring to kill their prey slowly, haunting their dreams 
night after night, these hags trap the tormented souls of 
their victims within dark gems so they might be sold in 
the infernal markets of the outer planes. Night hags vary 
widely in appearance, standing between 5-1/2 and 7 feet 
tall, and weighing from 150 to 300 pounds.

Grisly fetishes and the rags of once fine clothes hang off the corpse-
thin frame of this horrifying, sharp-fanged crone.

Smoke (Su) In battle, a nightmare 
exhales smoke that chokes and 
blinds foes, filling a 15-foot cone 
each round as a free action. 
Anyone in the cone must succeed 
on a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened 
until 1d6 minutes after leaving the area. This 
smoke acts as obscuring mist for the purposes of 
concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round. 
The save DC is Constitution-based. 
Nightmares are f laming harbingers 
of death. They allow only the most 
evil of creatures to ride them, and 
are never mere mounts, but rather 
willing partners in destruction.
The cauchemar is a more dangerous

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blinding Beauty (Su) This ability affects all humanoids within 
30 feet of a nymph. Those who look directly at a nymph 
must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be blinded 

permanently. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability 
as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Inspiration (Su) A nymph can choose an intelligent creature 
to inspire and serve as a muse by giving that creature 
some token of her affection (typically a lock of her hair). 
As long as the nymph retains her favor for this creature 
and as long as the creature carries the nymph’s token, 
the creature gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving 
throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. A bard who 
has a nymph for a muse in this way can use his 
bardic performance for an additional number 
of rounds per day equal to his nymph muse’s 
Charisma modifier. The nymph retains a 
link to her token and its carrier as if she 
had cast a status spell on the carrier. The 
nymph can end this effect at any time 
as a free action. A single nymph may 
only inspire one creature at a 
time in this manner.
Spells A nymph casts spells as 
a 7th-level druid, but cannot 
swap out prepared spells to cast 
summon spells.
Stunning glance (Su) As a 
standard action, a nymph can 
stun a creature within 30 feet with 
a look. The target must succeed 
on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be 
stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save 
DC is Charisma-based.
Unearthly grace (Su) A nymph 
adds her Charisma modifier as 
a racial bonus on all her saving 
throws, and as a deflection bonus to 
her Armor Class.
Wild Empathy (Su) This works like 
the druid’s wild empathy class 
feature, except the nymph has a +6 
racial bonus on the check. The nymph’s 
effective druid level is equal to her HD for 
determining her total modifer to the check. 
Many have lost their lives in vain search of the 
beauty of the nymph, and many more to the madness 
and obsession their grace has upon minds and bodies 
unprepared for their companionship. Yet the nymph 
herself is not a cruel creature—a guardian of nature’s 
purest places and most beautiful realms, she treats those 
who respect her and her abode with kindness, and may 
even favor someone who takes her fancy with magical 
gifts. Yet those who would seek to abuse or harm her or 
her home quickly find that behind her beauty is a fierce 
protector more than capable of defending her charge.

A delicate figure rises from the water, her long ears tapering to 
points above her head, her beauty painful in its perfection.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Acid (Ex) An ochre jelly secretes a digestive acid that dissolves 
only flesh (not bone) when it strikes a foe—creatures 
not made of flesh (including most constructs and oozes, 
skeletal undead, plants, and incorporeal creatures) are 
immune to the ochre jelly’s acid damage.
Split (Ex) Slashing weapons, piercing weapons, and electricity 
attacks deal no damage to an ochre jelly. Instead the 
creature splits into two identical jellies, each with half of the 
original creature’s current hit point total, rounded down. 
A jelly with 10 hit points or less cannot be further split and 
dies if reduced to 0 hit points.
Ochre jellies are animate masses of 
protoplasm hued a sickly combination 
of yellow, orange, and brown. At rest, 
their flat, pulsing bodies stand roughly 
6 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter—
in motion, they often ball up into quivering spherical 
shapes and almost seem to roll as they move. Their 
malleable bodies allow them to seep through cracks 
and holes far smaller than the space they fill. 
Creatures dwelling below ground often attempt 
to seal up any such cracks to fortify their lairs 
against ochre jellies. 

An ochre jelly’s highly specialized acid only dissolves 
f lesh. This discovery has led many poisoners and hack 
alchemists to search out specimens for their tinkering. 
Some specialized weapons have resulted from these 
experiments that target the living body in wicked ways. 
Rumors of a slow-release poison that breaks down the 
cellular walls in living creatures surfaced a few years ago, 
but its creator guards the secret with his life. 
Notes in a long-forgotten tome mention a burial 
practice used in faraway places that resembles cremation. 
Instead of burning the corpse to ashes, the practitioners 
seal the body into a stone sarcophagus with an ochre jelly 
so it can dissolve the body. Afterward, the morticians 
place the ochre jelly into a large canopic jar, complete 
with a bronze plaque naming the deceased. This practice 
protects items entombed with the body (which is quickly 
reduced to nothing but a polished skeleton), and the 
creature’s essence, it is believed, still rides along with the 
living jelly.
Ochre jellies stand about 6 inches tall, spread out to 
a little over 10 feet in diameter, and weigh upward of 
2,600 pounds. When in combat, they tend to pile up upon 
themselves and exude long, dripping pseudopods to slam 
and grapple anything that moves.
Although the typical ochre jelly has stats as presented 
here, in the deepest reaches of the underground world 
these mindless predators can grow to enormous sizes. 
Perhaps more disturbing, though, are rumors of ochre 
jellies that have developed additional methods of 
capturing prey. Adventurers speak of jellies capable of 
poisoning foes with a touch or exuding clouds of noxious 
gas that burns the eyes and throat, leaving those who 
draw too near helpless as the immense protoplasmic 
beast slithers over their bodies and begins to feed.

This yellow-orange amoeboid creature slithers across the ground, 
pseudopods grasping ahead of its slow approach.

Stories are told of ogres—horrendous stories of brutality 
and savagery, cannibalism and torture. Of rape and 
dismemberment, necrophilia, incest, mutilation, 
and all manners of hideous murder. Those who 
have not encountered ogres know the stories 
as warnings. Those who have survived such 
encounters know these tales to be tame compared 
to the truth.
An ogre revels in the misery of others. 
When smaller races aren’t available to crush 
between meaty fists or defile in blood-red 
lusts of violence, they turn to each other for 
entertainment. Nothing is taboo in ogre society. 
One would think that, left to themselves, an ogre 
tribe would quickly tear itself apart, with only 
the strongest surviving in the end—yet if there is 
one thing ogres respect, it is family.
Ogre tribes are known as families, and many of their 
deformities and hideous features arise from the common 
practice of incest. The leader of a tribe is most often the 
father of the tribe, although in some cases a particularly 
violent or domineering ogress claims the title of mother. 
Ogre tribes bicker among themselves, a trait that thankfully 

keeps them busy and turned against each other rather than 
neighboring races. Yet time and again, a particularly violent 
and feared patriarch rises among the ogres, one capable of 
gathering multiple families under his command.
Regions inhabited by ogres are dreary, ugly places, for 
these giants dwell in squalor and see little need to live 
in harmony with their environment. The borderland 
between civilization and ogre territory is a desperate 
realm of outcasts and despair, for here dwell the ogrekin, 
the deformed offspring and results of frequent ogre raids 
against the lands of the smaller folk.
Ogre games are violent and cruel, and victims they use 
for entertainment are lucky if they die the first day. Ogres’ 
cruel senses of humor are the only way their crude minds 
show any spark of creativity, and the tools and methods of 
torture ogres devise are always nightmarish.
An ogre’s great strength and lack of imagination makes 
it particularly suited for heavy labor, such as mining, 
forging, and clearing land, and more powerful giants 
(particularly hill giants and stone giants) often subjugate 
ogre families to serve them in such regards. 
A typical adult ogre stands 10 feet tall and weighs 
roughly 650 pounds.

This lumbering giant’s beady eyes are devoid of wit or kindness, 
and its puffy face features a wide mouth with ill-fitting teeth.

The ogre mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the 
Material Plane and clad in living flesh—in this case, that of 
a brutish ogre. Ogre mages are often found serving as leaders 
of ogre tribes, yet not all of them seek to link their destinies to 
their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone marauders 
who hold villages hostage, demanding regular 
tribute in the form of gold, food, or maidens, lest 
they take more than they ask.
Oni Traits
The oni are a diverse race of evil outsiders, 
of which the ogre mage is the most common. 

Other types of oni exist as well—evil spirits that clothe 
themselves in the f lesh of other types of humanoid. The 
majority of oni are giants, with goblinoid, tengu, and 
reptilian oni being relatively common as well.
While oni are incredibly varied in their shapes and 
powers, they still share certain traits in common.
•	Regeneration: All oni regenerate, although the rate of 
regeneration varies. Damage from fire or acid can kill 
an oni.
•	Change Shape: All oni are shapechangers, but their 
ability to change shape is generally limited to creatures 
similar in shape to their true form.
•	Native: Oni are native outsiders. As evil spirits clad in 
mortal humanoid f lesh, all oni also possess one of the 
humanoid subtypes—usually giant.

Clad in beautiful armor, this exotically garbed giant roars, its 
tusks glistening and its eyes afire with murderous intent.

Along with their brute strength and comparatively low 
intellect, the primary difference between orcs and the 
civilized humanoids is their attitude. As a culture, orcs 
are violent and aggressive, with the strongest ruling the 
rest through fear and brutality. They take what they want 
by force, and think nothing of slaughtering or enslaving 
entire villages when they can get away with it. They 
have little time for niceties or details, and their 
camps and villages tend to be filthy, ramshackle 
affairs filled with drunken brawls, pit fights, 
and other sadistic entertainment. Lacking the 
patience for farming and only able to shepherd 
the most robust and self-sufficient animals, orcs 
almost always find it easier to take what someone 
else has built than to create things themselves. 
They are arrogant and quick to anger when 
challenged, but only worry about honor so far 
as it directly benefits them to do so.

An adult male orc is roughly 6 feet tall and 210 pounds. 
Orcs and humans interbreed frequently, though this is 
almost always the result of raids and slave-taking rather 
than consensual unions. Many orc tribes purposefully 
breed for half-orcs and raise them as their own, as the 
smarter progeny make excellent strategists and leaders 
for their tribes.
Orc Characters
Orcs are defined by their class levels—they do not possess 
racial Hit Dice. All orcs have the following racial traits.
+4 Strength, –2 Intelligence, –2 Wisdom, –2 Charisma: 
Orcs are brutal and savage.
Darkvision: Orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.
Ferocity: See universal monster rules, page 300.
Light Sensitivity: See universal monster rules, page 301.
Weapon Familiarity: Orcs are always proficient with 
greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the 
word “orc” in its name as a martial weapon.
Languages: Orcs begin play speaking Common and 
Orc. Orcs with high Intelligence scores can choose from 
among the following bonus languages: Dwarven, Giant, 
Gnoll, Goblin, Undercommon.

Otyughs are particularly 
vile and horrid creatures 
that lurk in places most sane 
creatures avoid. Their lairs are 
middens, cesspools, offal pits, toxic 
swamps, and sewers—the greater a lair’s filth, the 
greater the draw to the refuse-eating otyugh. 
They glory in the role of scavenger, 
wandering through vast 
underground caverns 

in search of the choicest cuts of garbage and waste. Upon 
finding such refuse, they gorge upon it, gathering what 
cannot be consumed in one debauch to bring back to their 
foul-smelling lairs. Otyughs spend most of their time in 
these filthy dens, which they keep constantly filled with 
carrion, dung, and worse sorts of stinking eff luvia.
Intelligent creatures dwelling in subterranean areas near 
an otyugh often form a partnership of convenience with 
the disgusting beast. These creatures gladly provide their 
refuse and piles of raw meat to the otyugh, transforming 
the creature into an effective form of trash disposal. In 
return, the otyugh leaves its benefactors alone, and does 
not attack them, possibly even acting as a guardian.
The most horrifying thing to most races about the 
notorious otyugh is not the nature of its diet or its choice 
of lairs, but rather that a creature with an otyugh’s tastes 
can be anything other than a mindless scavenger. In fact, 
otyughs are surprisingly intelligent, and often quite eager to 
form alliances with those who offer them a steady supply 
of delicious diversions in the form of offal and waste. 
Most otyughs understand the fact that other creatures 
find them unpleasant and hideous, but few really care.

This three-legged freak is mostly mouth. Three tentacles, two 
tipped with barbs and one with eyes, extend from its sides.

The origin of the owlbear is a subject of 
great debate among scholars of the monstrous 
creatures of the world. However, most concur 
that at some point in the distant past, a 
deranged wizard created the original 
specimens by crossing an owl with a 
bear—perhaps as proof of some insane 
concept about the nature of life, 
but possibly out of sheer lunacy. 
Whatever the original purpose 
of such a freakish creation as 
the owlbear, the creature bred 
true and has become quite well-
established in woodlands across 
the world, where it plays a key role in a 
region’s ecosystem as an apex predator.
Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well 
known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage 
nature. They tend to attack without provocation, 
slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths. 
Many scholars that have encountered these 
creatures in the wild have noted that they all 
have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when 
they close in for an attack. This is sometimes 

presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all 
owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and 
kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it’s 
simply part of the way the massive bird-beast’s keen eyes 
are constructed.
Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the 
wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests 
or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at 
hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the 
prey available near their lairs.
Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small 
groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while 
they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 
juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece 
in many city markets.
While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate 
owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used 
as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to 
roam and hunt freely there. Professional animal trainers 
charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train an owlbear into a 
serviceable guardian that can obey simple commands (DC 
23 for a juvenile creature; DC 30 for a fully grown adult).
A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weighs 
up to 1,500 pounds.

The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that 
sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly 
prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures 
not easily befriended. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high 
at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan 
of 20 feet. Most pegasi are white, though occasionally one is 
hatched with conventional horse colors and markings.
The pegasus is, despite its appearance, as intelligent 
as a human. As such, those who try to train a pegasus to 
serve as a mount find the pegasus to be recalcitrant and 
even violent. A pegasus cannot speak, but it understands 
Common and greatly prefers the company of a good 
companion. The proper method to convince a pegasus to 
serve as a mount is to befriend it with diplomacy, favors, 
and good deeds. A pegasus is generally indifferent to a 
good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and 
hostile to an evil one—before a pegasus will serve as a 
mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via Diplomacy 
checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an 
exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle’s 
straps interfere with the creature’s wings. A pegasus can

and moves with a quiet and proud grace.

OOwwlbear–Pegasus

lbear–Pegasus

fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also 
attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Trained 
pegasi are not afraid of combat, and the rider does not 
need to make a Ride check each round merely to control 
his mount.
Pegasi lay eggs—they are worth 2,000 gp each on the 
open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. 
However, as they are intelligent, good-aligned creatures, 
selling eggs and young is essentially slavery and is looked 
down on or outlawed in good societies.
Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional 
trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which 
serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness 
for life.
A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium 
load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601–900 pounds.
In some pegasi, the blood of a mighty heroic stallion 
ancestor runs strong. These champions have the lifespan 
of a human, the advanced template, perfect f light 
maneuverability, fire resistance 10, a +4 racial bonus 
on saving throws against poison, and an immunity to 
petrification attacks. Some are able to speak a few words 
in Common or Celestial. They are fully aware of their 
superiority over common horses and pegasi, and need no 
training to f ly with a rider, but only allow themselves 
to be ridden by great heroes.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Ethereal Ambush (Ex) A phase spider that attacks foes on 
the Material Plane in a surprise round can take a full 
round of actions if it begins the combat by phasing 
into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane.
Ethereal jaunt (Su) A phase spider can shift from 
the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a 
free action, and shift back again as a move 
action (or as part of a move action). The 
ability is otherwise identical to ethereal 
jaunt (CL 15th).
Poison (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 
18; frequency 1/round for 8 rounds; 
effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 
2 consecutive saves. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.
Phase spiders are voracious predators 
from the Ethereal Plane who hunt 
on the Material Plane. When prey 
is located, the spider shifts to 
the Ethereal Plane to prepare 
an ambush. Against a lone 

victim, the spider shifts to the Material Plane, bites the 
victim, then retreats back to the Ethereal Plane to wait for 
the poison to take effect. Against multiple foes, a phase 
spider follows these same tactics, and on each round a 
foe remains in reach at the start of its turn, it repeats this 
gambit. If no foes are in reach, it moves while ethereal 
to prepare an attack on an available target, but unless it 
feels safe in spending an entire round on the Material, it 
won’t phase back to attack unless it can do so while saving 
a move action for an escape.
Phase spiders are the natural enemy of another denizen 
of the Ethereal Plane—the xill. The two races have long 
fought a bloody war with no real prospect of a resolution 
anytime soon. Were phase spiders less horrifying and 
alien in appearance, they might find the allies they need 
to defeat the sinister xill among other races, but their 
monstrous forms and often overwhelming hunger make 
diplomacy difficult.
On the Ethereal Plane, phase spiders can manipulate 
the raw smoky ether in a manner similar to how a spider 
manipulates webs. Vast, complex nests of semisolid 
ether f loat idly through the eddies of the Ethereal Plane, 
each supporting numerous phase spiders. The creatures 
enjoy each other’s company, but have no real concept 
of family—a newborn phase spider is fully capable of 
fending for itself and is treated no differently by its 
parents or siblings than any other.
The typical phase spider is 8 feet long and weighs about 
700 pounds.

This large spider-like monster has an eerie, humanoid face 
surrounded by a shaggy mane of fur.

negative level as soon as possible. A 
phoenix can self-resurrect only once 
per year. If a phoenix dies a second 
time before that year passes, its death 
is permanent. A phoenix that dies 
within the area of a desecrate spell 
cannot self-resurrect until the 
desecrate effect ends, at which 
point the phoenix immediately 
resurrects. A phoenix brought 
back to life by other 
means never gains 
negative levels as 
a result.

This immense bird seems to be made of living f lame. It spreads its 
wings and gives vent to a musical cry as it takes to the air.

Shroud of flame (Su) A phoenix can cause its feathers to 
burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are 
burning, it inflicts an additional 1d6 points of fire damage 
with each natural attack, and any creature within reach (20 
feet for most phoenixes) must make a DC 25 Reflex save 
each round to avoid taking 4d6 points of fire damage at the 
start of its turn. A creature that attacks the phoenix with 
natural or non-reach melee weapons takes 1d6 points of fire 
damage (no save) with each successful hit. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.
The phoenix is a legendary bird of fire that dwells in the 
most remote parts of the desert. As the birds are known 
to be great scholars, many seekers of rare lore search out 
particular phoenixes for advice. Yet it is the phoenix’s 
ability to rebirth itself from its own dead body for which 
the creature is best known.
The phoenix is a benevolent creature, aiding those who 
do good and actively harming those who do evil. 227

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Invisibility (Su) A pixie remains invisible even when it attacks. 
This ability is constant, but the pixie can suppress or 
resume it as a free action.
Special Arrows (Su) When a pixie fires an arrow from any 
bow, it can decide to change the arrow’s properties by 
sprinkling it with magical pixie dust. Doing so is a free 

action as long as the pixie is the one who fires the arrow. 
A pixie can generate a number of uses of dust equal to 
its Charisma score each day (16 uses per day for most 
pixies)—the dust is useless to another creature unless 
the pixie gives the dust freely. In this case, the pixie 
chooses what effect the dust will have on an arrow 
when it is applied, and it takes a standard action 
to apply the dust to the arrow. Once pixie dust 
is applied to an arrow, the pixie’s chosen effect 
persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long 
as an arrow is altered in this way, it does not 
inflict damage when it hits—it only causes 
its new effect. A pixie can choose any one of 
the following three effects when dusting an 
arrow. Save DCs are Charisma-based.
Charm: The target must succeed on a DC 15 
Will save or be affected as though by a charm 
monster spell for 10 minutes.
Memory Loss: The target must succeed 
on a DC 15 Will save or be affected by 
a modify memory spell (this effect can 
only eliminate the previous 5 minutes 
of memory—a pixie typically uses 
this ability to make the target forget it 
encountered the pixie so it won’t chase the 
pixie when he flees).
Sleep: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will 
save or fall asleep for 5 minutes.
Perhaps the best-known and most elusive of 
all fey creatures, pixies live in the deepest, 
most pristine forests, but their insatiable 
curiosity often leads them far from home. Most 
pixies stand just over 2 feet tall—though they 
typically f ly about the eye level of creatures 
they’re conversing with in order to maintain eye contact—
and weigh about 30 pounds. Pixies talk quickly and easily 
become overexcited.
Strange beings both of and beyond the natural world, 
pixies have magic that occasionally favors them in strange 
ways. For example, one out of every 10 pixies exhibits an 
additional spell-like ability that it can use once per day 
(caster level 8th), usually baleful polymorph, beast shape 
II (Tiny creatures only), or even a powerful spell like 
irresistible dance. Alternatively, you can change the types 
of effects that pixie dust can have on arrows—as a general 
rule, these alternate effects should be mind-affecting 
effects. Confusion, fear, hideous laughter, and hypnotism 
are all good choices for variant pixie arrow powers. You 
should take care when assigning alternate powers to a 
pixie, though, since doing so can create a threat that far 
exceeds what their physical statistics (and relatively low 
CR) can logically support.

This tiny, whimsical-looking humanoid darts about swiftly on 
wildly colored gossamer wings.

Pseudodragons are tiny cousins of true 
dragons, and are playful but shy. They 
often only vocalize in chirps, hisses, growls, 
and purrs, but can communicate telepathically with any 
intelligent creature. If approached peacefully and offered 
food, they are usually willing to share information about 
what they’ve seen in their territory, but threats or violence 
make them f lee.
Pseudodragons are carnivores, devouring 
insects, rodents, small birds, and snakes, 
though they sometimes eat eggs, and 
most also enjoy butter, cheese, 
and fish. They either hunt on 
the ground like lizards or 
look for prey on the wing like 
a raptor. As smart as a typical 

humanoid, they do not enjoy being treated as pets and 
prefer being treated as friends. They are wary of evil folk 
but can bond with sorcerers and wizards as familiars, and 
some have befriended druids and rangers or partnered 
with good dragons as scouts. Pseudodragons will serve as 
familiars if they approve of a spellcaster’s personality (and 
if the spellcaster takes the Improved Familiar feat), but 
often also bond with those whose company they enjoy or 
who have proven themselves true friends. A pseudodragon 
might follow another character in this manner for days, 
weeks, years, or even a lifetime if the creature is treated 
well, provided with food, and generally well-loved.
Upon reaching adulthood, a pseudodragon’s body is 
about 1 foot long with a 2-foot tail, and weighs about 7 
pounds. A pseudodragon egg is the size of a chicken egg, 
but leathery and spotted brown, and a mating female lays 
2–5 eggs every spring. A clutch of pseudodragons (the 
collective noun—not to be confused with pseudodragons 
from the same brood of eggs) usually consists of a mated 
pair and several near-adult offspring. 

This housecat-sized miniature dragon has fine scales, sharp 
horns, wicked little teeth, and a tail tipped with a barbed stinger.

Purple worms are giant scavengers 
that inhabit the deepest regions 
of the world, consuming any 
organic material that they 
encounter. They are notorious 
for swallowing their prey whole. 
It is not uncommon to hear of a 
group of adventurers vanishing down 
the ravenous maw of a purple worm, 
screaming as they disappear one 
by one.
Although they seek to 
consume living creatures, purple 
worms also consume vast amounts 

of dirt and minerals as they burrow underground. The 
insides of a purple worm may contain a considerable 
number of gemstones and other items able to withstand 
the corrosive acid inside its gullet. In areas filled with 
valuable minerals, such as those near dwarven mines, the 
natural tunnels created by burrowing purple worms are 
often filled with vast amounts of unrefined ores.
A purple worm usually claims a large underground 
cavern as its den, and while it returns here to rest and 
digest food, it spends the majority of its time on the 
prowl, burrowing through the endless dark or slithering 
along established tunnels in the constant drive to feed 
its immense hunger. Although not completely mindless, 
purple worms are rather stupid. They make popular 
guardians for those who have the magic to control them or 
a chamber in their lair large enough to hold one captive.
Although the deep-dwelling purple worm is the most 
common of its ilk, variant immense worms of differing 
colors dwell in other remote wildernesses. A sleek, 
mottled blue-and-green variant of the giant worm dwells 
in deep underground lakes or tropical seas (this variant 
loses its burrow speed but increases its swim speed to 40 
feet). A deep crimson variant of even greater size dwells 
in remote badlands and rocky deserts (this variant is 
never less than Colossal in size). Other species doubtless 
remain to be discovered in the far corners of the world.

This enormous worm is covered with dark purple plates of chitinous 
armor. Its giant, tooth-filled mouth is the size of an ox.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Detect Thoughts (Su) A rakshasa can 
detect thoughts as per the 
spell of the same name 
(CL 18th). It 
can suppress 

or resume this ability as a free action. When a rakshasa 
uses this ability, it always functions as if it had spent three 
rounds concentrating and thus gains the maximum amount 
of information possible. A creature can resist this effect 
with a DC 18 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
The rakshasa is an evil spirit that cloaks itself in the guise 
of a humanoid creature that it might walk unseen among 
its prey. They embody what is taboo among most societies, 
and in the shape of those it seeks to defile, a rakshasa gorges 
itself on these hideous acts. Were they human, these acts 
of cannibalism, blasphemy, and worse would mark them as 
criminals condemned to the cruelest of hells. 
When not disguised as a humanoid, the otherwise 
humanoid rakshasa has the head of an animal. Often, they 
possess the heads of  great cats (such as a tiger or panther) 
or a snake (like a cobra or viper), yet other heads are not 
unknown—apes, jackals, vultures, elephants, 
mantises, lizards, rhinos, boars, and more 
are possible. In most cases, the type of 
head a rakshasa possesses speaks in some 
way to its personality—a tiger-headed 
rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while a 
boar-headed one might be gluttonous 
and crude. These changes rarely 
impact the rakshasa’s base 
statistics, although there are 
more powerful variants 
of the standard rakshasa 
that possess multiple 
heads, more potent spellcasting 
powers, and additional deadly 
and unusual special abilities.  
Rakshasas scoff at religion—
they understand the power of 
the divine, but see themselves 
as the only thing worthy of 
worship from the mortal races. 
Rakshasa clerics are thus quite 
rare. Although rakshasas are 
outsiders, they are also very 
much creatures of the Material 
Plane, and many believe the first 
rakshasas chose this exile over some 
other role offered them by a long-
forgotten god. Although they usually 
work alone, it isn’t unheard of to find 
extended families of rakshasas working 
together to ruin a mortal civilization 
from the inside out over the course of 
many generations. A rakshasa is 
6 feet tall and weighs 
180 lbs.

This figure’s backward-bending fingers and its bestial, snarling 
visage leave little doubt as to its fiendish nature.

killing a full-grown human with

are often found in the sewers

heat (Su) An enraged remorhaz generates heat so 
intense that anything touching its body takes 8d6 
points of fire damage. Creatures striking a 
remorhaz with natural attacks or unarmed 
strikes are subject to this damage, but 
creatures striking with melee weapons 
are not. The heat can melt or burn 
weapons; any weapon that strikes a 
remorhaz is allowed a DC 19 Fortitude save 
to avoid taking damage. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.
In a world of ice and snow, the remorhaz is 
particularly feared for the terrible fires that burn 
within its body. These internal fires cause the armor 
plates along its back to glow red-hot when the creature is 
particularly angry, excited, or in pain. Creatures adapted 
to arctic regions are often particularly vulnerable to fire, 
making the remorhaz’s primary defense an incredibly

potent one and securing its role as a dangerous predator 
in such frozen reaches.
Remorhazes dwell in extensive warrens carved into 
the hearts of glaciers. The beasts use their heat to melt 
tunnels through ice, tunnels whose smooth glassy sides 
swiftly refreeze in their wake to create uncommonly 
stable and numerous mazes.
Although the remorhaz has much in common superficially 
with lesser vermin, the beast is surprisingly intelligent. While 
not capable of speech, the typical remorhaz has a good grasp 
of the Giant tongue, and tribes of giants often use this to their 
advantage to secure allegiances with the great beasts. Frost 
giants are particularly obsessed with them, for those giants 
who brave the cruel and deadly burns a remorhaz can inflict 
to become “worm friends” gain a potent weapon to use against 
their enemies—an assassin capable of burrowing up through 
the floor of a glacial keep to strike directly against a frost 
giant’s greatest weakness: fire. Other giants use the beasts as 
living forges, for their backs are hot enough to melt metal.
A remorhaz is 25 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds.

Relentless (Su) A retriever is constantly under the effects of spider 
climb and water walk; these abilities cannot be dispelled.
Not all constructs are formed from unliving matter like 
stone, wood, metal, or dead f lesh. In the darkest corners 
of the Great Beyond, certain powerful demon lords have 
mastered the art of shaping the raw, protoplasmic f lesh 
of the Abyss into hideous monstrosities devoid of life, 
emotion, and the will to resist control. The monstrous 
retriever is the best-known of such constructs, a huge 
spider-like creation capable of unleashing potent energy 
upon those it has been ordered to seek.
Demon lords use retrievers to seek out those who dare 
abandon their loyalties or f lee from servitude. Often, the 
presence of a retriever in a demon’s den is enough in and 
of itself to ensure the loyalty of the lesser demons. The 
constructs also excel in tracking down specific objects 
and returning them to their masters—their intelligence 
is just enough to allow them to focus on their ordered 
tasks but not quite enough for them to form ideas of

A retriever’s body is the size of an elephant, 
and its legspan is nearly 30 feet. It weighs 
6,500 pounds.
Conjuring a Retriever
Although a retriever is not an outsider, 
it may nonetheless be conjured by either 
greater planar ally or greater planar binding. The 
spellcaster must take care to do so, however, 
using special rare incenses and complex 
diagrams inked on the f loor and walls using 
expensive phosphorescent inks, 
lest the retriever attack 
the spellcaster upon 
completion of the spell. 
These components 
cost 25,000 gp and 
replace the usual 
costs associated 
with casting either 
spell (including 
greater planar 
binding‘s Charisma 
check requirement).

The rhinoceros feeds on leafy 
plants, branches, and even 
thorny shrubs. Its thick hide 
is a mottled gray color, and it 
can run surprisingly fast for a 
beast of its size. The rhinoceros 
is notoriously short-tempered 
and prone to attacking anything 
it perceives as approaching too 
closely (generally within a distance 
of 80 feet—the distance of a single 
charge—for most rhinos).

The woolly rhinoceros is an 
herbivore, though unlike 
its non-woolly cousin it 
grazes for food rather 
than browsing on 
larger plants. The 
woolly rhino is 
legendary for its 
foul temper, and its 
size and huge horn 
give it a ferocious 
bravery. Any threat 
(real or perceived) 
to the rhino or 
its herd is met 
with loud bellows 
and the stomping of 
feet. Often, those who 
unwittingly anger a 
woolly rhino have 
no time to amend 
the intrusion before 
the beast attacks. 

This rhinoceros has a low-slung head with twisted ears that lie 
back along its neck.

This large rhinoceros has a shaggy pelt of long, brown fur and a 
row of immense horns on its snout and brow.

nevertheless may find themselves accidentally consumed 
by the feeding roc.
Rocs are equally comfortable over land and sea. While 
they are capable of sleeping in the air as they soar solo 
across great ranges in search of food, they generally 
return home to the mountains to roost and procreate. 
They prefer rocky crags that are completely inaccessible 
by terrestrial means, building 
vast nests of tree trunks and 
ruined masonry. Once a 
decade, a mated pair lays a 
clutch of 3–5 eggs and raises its 
young. Outside of mating, rocs 
are extremely antisocial, and may 
attack others of their kind in vicious 
aerial battles in order to establish their 
territorial boundaries. When a nest contains eggs 
or chicks, parents trade off in their long-ranging 
f lights, with one restricting its wanderings to 
within a 10-mile radius of the nest.
Rocs are most commonly white but can be a 
number of different colors, from dark brown or 
gold to black or blood red. Their 
massive feathers are highly prized, 
and their eggs even more so. Due 
to their scarcity and the high risk 
involved in harvesting them, a 
single man-sized roc egg can net 
4,000 gp if transported to market 
undamaged. A roc can be trained 
as well as any other animal, but its great 
size makes this a daunting task for most 
would-be trainers of human size. The same isn’t true 
for giants—particularly cloud and storm giants, who 
often use trained rocs as guardians for their lairs. Rocs 
are even large enough to serve as mounts for the most 
prestigious of giants.
Rocs taken as animal companions by druids or rangers 
are typically newly hatched birds—a baby roc is the size of 
a person and ready for f light and hunting within minutes 
of hatching. Unfortunately for druids seeking animal 
companions of legendary size, an animal companion roc 
is limited to Large size—still large enough for a Medium 
druid or ranger to use the f lying beast as a mount.

Rocs are terrifying, legendary birds renowned for their 
ability to carry off elephants and other big animals. A 
typical roc is 30 feet long from beak to tail, with an 80-
foot wingspan and weight of up to 8,000 pounds. While 
their beaks are hooked like an eagle’s and designed for 
slashing and tearing, most rocs prefer to seize prey in 
their massive, clawed talons and drop them from great 
heights before feasting on the shattered remains. For this 
reason, they are often followed by f locks of scavengers 
like rooks, buzzards, and eagles hoping to steal portions 
of the roc’s messy meals. The roc generally ignores such 
opportunists, but if the scavengers don’t take care, they

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Strands (Ex) A roper can extend up to six thin, 
sticky strands from its body at a time, launching them to 
a maximum range of 50 feet. A roper’s attacks with 
its strands resolve as ranged touch attacks. These 
strands are quite strong, but can be severed by 
any amount of slashing damage (a strand is AC 
20). A creature struck by a strand is numbed and 
weakened by the strange material, and must make 
a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength 
damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
The roper is an ambush hunter. Capable of altering 
the coloration and shape of its body, a roper in hiding 
looks remarkably like a stalagmite of stone or ice (or 
in low-ceilinged chambers, a stony or icy pillar). In 
areas without such features to hide among, a roper can 
compress its body into a much more squat, boulder-like 
shape. The strands it extrudes are not f lesh but a thick, 

A huge eye opens in this conical creature’s front, just above a toothy 
mouth. Long strands of fibrous material whip from its sides.

RRooc–Roper

c–Roper

semiliquid material similar to partially melted wax but 
with the strength of an iron chain and the ability to numb 
f lesh and sap strength. The roper can manipulate these 
strands with great finesse, and can f ling them as far as 50 
feet to snatch objects that attract its attention.
Although alien and monstrous in shape, the roper is 
in fact one of the most intelligent denizens of the deep 
caverns of the world. They do not form large societies 
(although ropers can be found living among some 
deep-dwelling denizens like the intellect devourers 
or neothelids, with whom they have been known to 
sometimes ally), but often congregate in small clusters. 
Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and 
death and the finer points of the more cruel and sinister 
religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours 
with those it initially sought merely to eat. Stories speak of 
particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have 
been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational 
companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets 
don’t eventually escape, a roper’s appetite always wins out 
over its intellectual curiosity—especially in cases where 
pets are constantly outmaneuvering their keeper’s wits 
and patience.
A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.

Environment any underground
Organization solitary, pair, or nest (3–10)
Treasure incidental (no metal treasure)
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Rust (Su) A rust monster’s antennae are a primary 
touch attack that causes any metal 
object they touch to swiftly rust 
and corrode. The object 
touched takes half its 
maximum hp in damage 
and gains the broken 
condition—a second hit 
destroys the item. A rust 
monster never provokes 
attacks of opportunity 
by attempting to strike a 
weapon with its antennae. 
Against creatures made of 
metal, a rust monster’s antennae 
deal 3d6+5 points of damage. An 
attended object, any magic object, or 
a metal creature can attempt a DC 15 
Reflex save to negate this effect. The 
save DC is Constitution-based.
Scent Metals (Ex) 
This ability 
functions much 
the same as the scent 
ability, except that the range is 90 feet and the rust 

monster can only use it to sense metal objects (including 
creatures wearing or carrying metal objects).
Of all the terrifying beasts an explorer might encounter 
underground, only the rust monster targets that which 
the average adventurer values most: his treasure.
Typically 5 feet long and weighing almost 200 pounds, 
the lobster-like rust monster would be frightening 
enough even without the alien feeding process that 
gives it its name. Rust monsters consume metal objects, 
preferring iron and ferrous alloys like steel but devouring 
even mithral, adamantine, and enchanted metals with 
equal ease. Any metal touched by the rust monster’s 
delicate antennae or armored hide corrodes and falls to 
dust within seconds, making the beast a major threat to 
subterranean adventurers and those dwarven miners who 
must defend their forges and compete for ore. 
Though rust monsters have no innate tendency toward 
violence, their insatiable hunger leads them to charge 
anything they come across that bears even trace amounts 
of metal, and any resistance is met with unthinking 
savagery. It’s not unheard of for rust monsters in metal-
poor areas to track escaped victims for days using their 
scent metal ability, provided the victims retain intact 
metal objects. Fortunately, it’s often possible to escape a 
rust monster’s attentions by throwing it a dense metal 
object like a shield and running in the opposite direction. 
Those who frequent areas infested with rust monsters 
quickly learn to keep a few stone or wooden weapons 
close at hand.

This insectile monster has four legs, a strange propeller-shaped 
protrusion at the end of its tail, and two long, feathery antennae.

with 10 bolts, other treasure)
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Blood frenzy (Ex) Once per day, a sahuagin 
that takes damage in combat can fly into 
a frenzy in the following round. It gains +2 
Constitution and +2 Strength, but takes a 
–2 penalty to its AC. The frenzy lasts 
as long as the battle or 1 minute, 
whichever is shorter.
Speak with Sharks (Su) A sahuagin 
can communicate telepathically with 
sharks to a distance of 150 feet. This 
communication is limited to simple concepts, such 
as “come here,” “defend me,” or “attack this target.”

Ravenous and cruel, the sahuagin are, unfortunately, 
among the most prosperous oceanic races. Great cities 
raised by these creatures darken the deep ocean trenches, 
and many are the near-coastal fortresses where they 
launch endless raids against their air-breathing enemies 
who dwell in close proximity to the shore. Warlike and 
proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most 
other aquatic races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and 
their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to 
respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, 
for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much 
of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs 
about 250 pounds.
Sahuagin are prone to beneficial mutations, and when 
a mutant is born it almost always rises to the society’s 
nobility or rulership. The most common sahuagin 
mutation is an extra pair of arms (granting two additional 
claw attacks or the opportunity to wield more weapons). 
Rumors speak of the rare malenti—sahuagin who look 
not like sharkmen but aquatic elves, yet who share their 
kin’s bloodlusts and cruel natures. Malenti often serve as 
spies and assassins for sahuagin rulers, but rumors of all-
malenti tribes in isolated reaches of the sea persist.

This scaly humanoid has a long, fish-like tail. Its arms and legs 
end in webbed claws, and its piscine head features a toothy maw.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
heat (Ex) A salamander generates so much heat that its mere 
touch deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. A 
salamander’s metallic weapons also conduct this heat.
Salamanders are native to the Plane of Fire, where their 
legions of fierce warriors are much feared by the other 
inhabitants of the plane. Because some of the stronger 
elemental fire races enslave salamanders for their 
metalworking skill and fighting prowess, the 
salamanders hate the efreet and other inhabitants 
with a passion.
Though their lairs typically hover in temperatures 
of 500 degrees F or more, salamanders can tolerate 
lower temperatures. They generally do so only when 
forced, and are even surlier and more short-tempered 
than normal in such environments. Although they hail 

from the Plane of Fire, the salamander race identifies more 
with the Abyss, and they hold demons (particularly those 
associated with fire, like balors and certain fire-themed 
demon lords) in great esteem. It’s not unusual to encounter 
large groups of salamanders in the Abyss as a result.
Salamanders are often conjured to the Material 
Plane to serve as guardians or, more commonly, to craft 
weapons, armor, and other metalwork, for their skill in 
these areas is legendary. Salamanders also infest areas 
of the Material Plane where the boundaries between this 
world and the Plane of Fire have worn thin, such as in and 
near volcanoes.
Because their habitat is so extreme, salamanders only 
save treasure that can withstand high temperatures, such 
as swords, armor, jewels, rods, and other items made from 
high-melting-point metals. Salamander society is a cruel 
one based on power and the ability to subjugate those 
beneath oneself. Beings beneath a salamander that cause 
it discomfort are dealt a slow and painful death.

chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of 
the pipes’ effects cannot be affected by the same set of 
pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the satyr’s 
other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr’s use of his 
pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spell-
like abilities, and if separated from them he may continue 
to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are 
masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 
week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Satyrs, known in some regions as fauns, are debauched 
and hedonistic creatures of the deepest, most primeval 
parts of the woods. They adore wine, music, and carnal 
delights, and are renowned as rakes and smooth-talkers, 
wooing unwary maidens and shepherd boys and leaving 
a trail of awkward explanations and unplanned pregnancies 
in their wakes.
Though their bodies are almost always those of attractive 
and well-built men, much of the satyrs' talent for 
seduction lies in their talent for music. With the 
aid of his eponymous pipes, a satyr is capable 
of weaving a wide variety of melodic 
spells designed to enchant others 
and bring them in line with his 
capricious desires.
In addition to their constant 
frolicking, satyrs often act as 
guardians of the creatures in 
their forest homes, and any 
who manage to turn the satyr’s 
lust to wrath are likely to 
find themselves facing down 

dangerous animals surrounding the faun. 
Still, while satyrs tend to value their own 
amusement well above 
the rights of others, they 
bear no ill will toward 
those they seduce. 
Children born from 
such encounters are 
always full-blooded 
satyrs, and are 
generally spirited 
away by their 
riotous kin soon 
after birth.

Giant scorpions are monstrous versions of the more 
common desert scorpion. They are likely to attack any 
creature that approaches. Giant scorpions usually charge 
when attacking, grabbing prey in their pincers, then 
lashing their segmented tails forward to kill their 
victim with injected venom.
Giant scorpions are just over 8 feet long from 
head to the base of the tail; the tail adds an 
additional 8 feet or so, although it is usually 
curled up over the scorpion’s back. Giant 
scorpions weigh between 2,000 and 
6,000 pounds.
Giant scorpions normally feed 
on other giant vermin, as well 
as large mammals that they 
paralyze with their venom, but 
they will attack and eat any 
living creature that ventures too 

close. In turn, giant scorpions are preyed upon by purple 
worms and other large predators.
Giant scorpions engage in complex courtship rituals 
when they mate, grasping each other’s pincers, arching 
their tails, and performing a circular “dance.” Soon 
after mating, the male usually retreats to avoid being 
cannibalized by the female.
Female scorpions do not lay eggs; they give birth to live 
young in broods of a dozen or so. The mother carries her 
brood on her back until the young are old enough to fend 
for themselves and hunt their own prey.
Giant scorpions live in underground burrows, either as 
solitary hunters or in small colonies, and will sometimes 
take up residence in man-made ruins or dungeons if food 
is plentiful. Giant scorpion colonies are usually made up 
of scorpions from the same brood that have yet to strike 
out on their own.
Other species of scorpions exist as well, some smaller 
but most quite a bit larger and favoring different terrains, 
such as forests, plains, or even underground. You can adjust 
the stats for the giant scorpion by changing Hit Dice and 
size (adjusting Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as 
appropriate) to represent a wide range of species. The 
following table lists the most common variants.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Evil Eye (Su) Three times per day, a 
sea hag can cast her dire gaze upon 
any single creature within 30 feet. 
The target must succeed on a DC 14 
Will save or be staggered as strange 
nebulous distress and a gnawing 
sense of impending doom plagues 
the victim. If a sea hag uses her evil 
eye on someone already afflicted 
by this curse, the victim must 
make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be 
overwhelmed with fright and collapse into 
a comatose state for 3 days. Each day that 
passes, the comatose victim must 
make a DC 14 Fortitude save or 
perish. The evil eye is a mind-
affecting fear effect. The save 
DCs are Charisma-based. 
Evil Eye Curse: Gaze—failed 
save; save Will DC 14; frequency 

1/day; effect staggered (or fall comatose if already under the 
effects of the evil eye).
horrific Appearance (Su) The sight of a sea hag is so revolting 
that anyone within 60 feet (other than another hag) who 
sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save 
or instantly be weakened, taking 1d6 points of Strength 
damage. Creatures that are affected by this power or that 
successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the 
same hag’s horrific appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-
affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Monstrous sea witches, these wicked hags possess 
terrifying features that few dare look upon. Reveling in 
discord, the foul creatures drag sailors to watery graves 
and torment the peoples of the oceans with wicked 
promises. Sea hags are always terrible to look upon, and 
despite their gluttonous ways, they are usually emaciated 
creatures who look half-starved. Most stand about 6 feet 
tall and weigh 150 pounds.
Sea hags prefer to dwell 
relatively close to shore 
where fishermen and 
trading vessels are more 
commonly encountered. 
Most choose to live far 
from urban areas so that 
their acts don’t draw as 
much attention from 
would-be enemies, but 
it’s not uncommon for 
a particularly brave or 
eager sea hag to settle in a 
city harbor or in the mouth of 
a deep river. 
Sea hags form covens similar 
to other hags, but their aquatic 
nature generally keeps them 
from forming mixed covens. 
In the case of a shoreline-
dwelling green hag (often 
a green hag who dwells 
in a saltmarsh or other 
coastal swampland), 
a coven often consists 
of two sea hags who 
look to the green hag as 
their mother and leader. 
More commonly, a sea hag 
coven consists of a group 
of particularly friendly and 
sisterly sea hags. See page 
167 for more details on hag 
covens.

Hair like rotting seaweed drapes this ancient witch. Loose, algae-
colored skin sags off her starved frame.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Capsize (Ex) A sea serpent can attempt 
to capsize a boat or ship of its size 
or smaller by ramming it as a charge 
attack and making a combat maneuver 
check. The DC of this check is 25 or the 
result of the boat captain’s Profession 
(sailor) check, whichever is higher.
Elusive (Su) Sea serpents have long 
been the stuff of maritime legends, 
but despite countless attempts to hunt 
them, they are rarely encountered unless 
they wish it. As a full-round action while in 
water, a sea serpent can move up to its run 
speed (300 ft.) without leaving any 
trace of its passing (identical in 
effect to a pass without trace). 
An elusive sea serpent gains 
a +40 circumstance bonus 
to its Stealth check. In 
addition, except when in 
combat, a sea serpent is 

considered to be under the effects of a nondetection spell. 
Both of these spell effects are at caster level 20th and 
cannot be dispelled.
Tales of immense sea serpents have colored the accounts 
of seagoing folk since the first ship sailed beyond sight of 
land. Yet proof of these immense and elusive creatures is 
remarkably difficult to come by, for not only is the ocean 
vast and the true sea serpent rare, but these creatures are 
quite adept at both avoiding capture and destroying ships 
bent on such a daunting task. Due to the sea serpent’s 
hermitic nature, many sailors take to ascribing the 
sighting of such a beast to an omen, although whether 
the sighting portends peril or providence depends as 
much upon the ship’s morale as it does anything else—
the sea serpent itself has little interest in prophecy, and 
only its hunger determines how dangerous its proximity 
to a curious ship can be.
Although sea serpents are little more than animals, 
they possess about them an air of mysticism that even old 
salts and cynics are forced to admit quickens the heart 
and buoys (or sinks) the spirit. Reports of sea serpent 
sightings are just as likely to encourage travel as they 
are to cause panic among seafarers, as explorers 
and adventurers f lock to the site in hopes of 
sighting such a legendary creature.
Typical sea serpents are 60 feet 
in length and weigh 4,500 pounds, 
but their upward size limit is 
unknown. Certainly, the sea 
is a vast and mysterious place 
more than capable of supporting 
whales and other 
such leviathans, 
and tales of sea 
serpents that 
exceed lengths 
of 300 feet or more 
are not unheard of. 
You can generate 
statistics for a sea 
serpent of such 
tremendous size by 
applying the advanced 
simple template or the 
giant simple template to 
the statistics presented 
here. Alternatively, 
you can advance this 
sea serpent to Colossal 
size, increasing its Hit 
Dice to 25 and its CR

Spine-frilled neck arching up from the water like a snake ready to 
strike, this ship-sized serpent hisses a challenge.

The sinister shadow skirts the border

foolish enough to stumble into its

other than to sap life and

Greater shadows are those undead

particularly infused with negative 
energy, such as those that have 
spent vast lengths of time in areas 
of the Plane of Shadow awash in 
negative energy, or those that have 
drained the lives of thousands 
of victims. These undead 
monsters are often found 
with a small band of normal 
shadows, which typically treat 
a greater shadow as a leader to 
rally behind.

Barely seen out of the corner of the eye, this wisp of shadow is

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Electric fortitude (Ex) Shambling mounds 
take no damage from electricity. Instead, 
any electricity attack used against a 
shambling mound temporarily increases 
its Constitution score by 1d4 points. The 
shambling mound loses these temporary 
points at the rate of 1 per hour.
Shambling mounds, also called shamblers, 
appear to be heaps of rotting vegetation. They 
are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants 
with a fondness for elf f lesh in particular. 
What serve as a shambler’s brain and 
sensory organs are located in its upper 
body. Shambling mounds typically 
have an 8-foot girth and stand between 
6 and 9 feet tall. They weigh about 
3,800 pounds.

Shambling mounds are strange creatures, more akin 
to animate tangles of creeping parasitic vines than single 
rooted plants. They are omnivorous, able to draw their 
sustenance from nearly anything, wrapping their creepers 
around living trees to draw forth the sap, sending rootlets 
into the soil to absorb raw nutrients, or consuming f lesh 
and bone from crushed prey.
Shamblers are frighteningly stealthy in their native 
environments. Blending in with the surrounding terrain, 
they can lie in wait for days on end without moving, 
waiting patiently for a potential meal. A shambler could 
be almost anywhere at any time, attacking without 
warning and not caring whether it leaves any survivors, 
so long as it acquires its next meal.
Shambling mounds normally lead solitary, nomadic 
existences in deep forests and fetid swamps, although 
they can also be found underground living among damp 
fungal thickets. Disturbing rumors persist, however, of 
shamblers gathering in strange congregations around 
great earthen mounds in the depths of marshes and 
jungles, often during the height of violent electrical 
storms. Their reasons for doing so are unknown, and 
many sages have wondered whether there is some obscure 
and alien purpose at work.

A mass of tangled vines and dripping slime rises on two trunk-
like legs, reeking of rot and freshly turned earth.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Electricity Sense (Ex) Shocker lizards automatically detect any 
electrical discharges within 100 feet.
Shock (Su) Shocker lizards can deliver an electrical shock 
to a single opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 1d8 
points of nonlethal electricity damage to living 
opponents (Reflex DC 12 half). This save DC 
is Constitution-based. Additionally, if 
two or more shocker lizards are within 
20 feet of each other, they can work 
together to create a lethal shock once 
every 1d4 rounds. This effect has a 
radius of 20 feet, centered on any 
one contributing lizard. All creatures 
within that radius take 2d8 points 
of lethal electricity damage for each 
lizard contributing to the shock, to 
a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save 
(DC 10 + the number of lizards 
contributing) halves the damage. 
A shocker lizard has a pale yellow 
underside, with bright green scales 
elsewhere on its 3-foot-long body, 

and weighs about 25 pounds. Shocker lizards tend toward 
group living, as their electrical abilities grow in power 
when they are close to another lizard. 
A shocker lizard colony is usually located near a source 
of water. Once the colony has settled on a location, the 
lizards become very territorial and attack anything that 
intrudes on them. A solitary shocker lizard is a timid and 
hesitant creature—but when several of them gather they 
become formidable and fearsome opponents capable of 
killing creatures several times their own size.
A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in 
combat, and a lizard tends to bite only after its shock has 
rendered an opponent unconscious, or when the shock 
seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard f lees once 
it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are 
nearby, they all hone in on their comrade’s discharges 
and attempt to administer lethal shocks to their foe.
Many have attempted to capture and tame shocker 
lizards, but this often proves a difficult and painful 
task. Alone and in captivity, shocker lizards tend to 
wither and die swiftly unless their keepers spend a lot 
of time grooming and playing with the lizards to keep 
them company. Kept in pairs or larger numbers, captive 
shocker lizards thrive, but their increasing electrical 
ability makes them more difficult to manage for keepers 
who aren’t themselves immune to electricity.

This dog-sized lizard has two horns, one on either side of its head, 
and green scales that crackle with sparks of lightning.

for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting 
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This immense mound of black slime thunders forward, eyes and 
mouths and even stranger things forming in its heaving bulk.

Engulf (Ex) To use this ability, the shoggoth must begin its 
turn grappling a creature or must trample. A shoggoth 
may attempt to engulf as many creatures as it grapples 
or tramples in a round. This ability otherwise functions as 
swallow whole, save that a creature that cuts is way out of a 
shoggoth leaves no hole in the protoplasmic creature’s body.
Although even lunatics and doom-saying prophets 
desperately claim the monstrous shoggoth is nothing 
more than a drug-induced vision or thankfully unreal 
nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. The 
shoggoths exist, although they keep to the deepest of 
ocean trenches or the most remote of forgotten caverns 
and ruins, emerging only rarely to spread madness and 
destruction in their slime-caked wakes.
The first shoggoths were created in eons past, long 
before the first gods turned their attentions to the 
Material Plane. Some hold that the aboleths engineered 
them, while certain strange texts hint of a race even older 
that engineered the first shoggoths as slaves. Eventually, 
these dread beasts developed enough intelligence to rebel 
against their creators, and now they lurk, patient but 
potent, in the lightless deep.

Skeletons are the animated bones of the dead, brought 
to unlife through foul magic. While most skeletons are 
mindless automatons, they still possess an evil cunning 
imparted to them by their animating force—a cunning 
that allows them to wield weapons and wear armor.
Creating a Skeleton
“Skeleton” is an acquired template that can be added to 
any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a 
skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
Challenge Rating: Depends on Hit Dice, as follows:
hD CR XP
1/2 1/6 65
1 1/3 135
2–3 1 400
4–5 2 600
6–7 3 800
8–9 4 1,200
10–11 5 1,600
12–14 6 2,400
15–17 7 3,200
18–20 8 4,800
Alignment: Always neutral evil.

Type: The creature’s type changes to undead. It retains 
any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) 
and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not 
gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature’s 
statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
Armor Class: Natural armor bonus changes as follows:
Skeleton Size natural Armor Bonus
Tiny or smaller +0
Small +1
Medium or Large +2
Huge +3
Gargantuan +6
Colossal +10
Hit Dice: A skeleton drops any HD gained from class levels 
and changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD 
are treated as if they have 1 racial HD. If the creature has 
more than 20 Hit Dice, it can’t be made into a skeleton by the 
animate dead spell. A skeleton uses its Cha modifier (instead 
of its Con modifier) to determine bonus hit points.
Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, 
and Will +1/2 HD + 2. 
Defensive Abilities: A skeleton loses the base creature’s 
defensive abilities and gains DR 5/bludgeoning and 
immunity to cold. It also gains all of the standard 
immunities and traits possessed by undead creatures.
Speed: A winged skeleton can’t use its wings to f ly. If the 
base creature f lew magically, so can the skeleton. All other 
movement types are retained.
Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, 
manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies 
of the base creature, except for attacks that can’t work 
without f lesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack 
per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw 
attacks at its full attack bonus. A claw attack deals damage 
depending on the skeleton’s size (see pages 301–302). If the 
base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use 
the skeleton claw damage only if it’s better.
Special Attacks: A skeleton retains none of the base 
creature’s special attacks.
Abilities: A skeleton’s Dexterity increases by +2. It has 
no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and 
Charisma scores change to 10.
BAB: A skeleton’s base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its 
Hit Dice.
Skills: A skeleton loses all skill ranks possessed by the 
base creature and gains none of its own.
Feats: A skeleton loses all Feats possessed by the base 
creature and gains Improved Initiative as a bonus feat.
Special Qualities: A skeleton loses most special qualities 
of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special 
qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks.

The pile of bones suddenly stirs, rising up to take on a human 
shape. Its long, bony fingers reach out to claw at the living.

SSkkeelleton

eton

Environment: Any, usually the same as base creature.
Organization: Any.
Treasure: Generally none, although sometimes a 
skeleton’s creator arms it with magical armor or weapons.
variant	skeletons
Numerous variant skeletons exist, such as those whose 
bones burn with an unending fire and those who drip 
with gore and reassemble themselves over time. Both of 
these variant skeletons can be created using animate dead, 
but they count as twice their normal number of Hit Dice 
per casting. Once controlled, they count normally against 
the controller’s limit.
Perhaps the most dangerous variant skeleton, though, is 
the skeletal champion. This skeleton retains its intellect, 
and often any class levels it possessed in life. A skeletal 
champion cannot be created with animate dead—these 
potent undead only arise under rare conditions similar to 
those that cause the manifestation of ghosts or via rare and 
highly evil rituals.
Each of the following skeleton types modifies the base 
skeleton in a few key ways. Except as noted, these variations 
can be stacked with one another—it’s possible to have a 
bloody burning skeletal champion.
Bloody Skeleton
A bloody skeleton is coated in a slick layer of blood and 
gore infused with negative energy. This gore allows the 
skeleton to reform and heal itself. In addition to the 
changes for the skeleton template, make the following 
adjustments to the base creature.
Challenge Rating: As a normal skeleton + 1.
Fast Healing: A bloody skeleton has fast 
healing equal to 1 per 2 Hit Dice it possesses 
(minimum 1).
Saves: A bloody skeleton gains channel 
resistance +4.
Abilities: A bloody skeleton’s Charisma is 14.
Special Qualities: A bloody skeleton gains 
the deathless special quality.
Deathless (Su): A bloody skeleton is destroyed 
when reduced to 0 hit points, but it returns to unlife 1 hour 
later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing thereafter to 
resume healing it. A bloody skeleton can be permanently 
destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced 
to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its 
remains are sprinkled with a vial of holy water.
Burning Skeleton
A burning skeleton is surrounded by an aura of f lames 
that deals fire damage to those it strikes. In addition to 
the changes for the skeleton template, make the following 
adjustments to the base creature.

Challenge Rating: As a normal skeleton + 1.
Aura: Burning skeletons possess a fiery aura.
Fiery Aura (Ex): Creatures adjacent to a burning skeleton 
take 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of their turn. 
Anyone striking a burning skeleton with an unarmed 
strike or natural attack takes 1d6 points of fire damage.
Defensive Abilities: Burning skeletons lose their 
immunity to cold but gain immunity to fire. A burning 
skeleton gains vulnerability to cold damage.
Melee Attacks: A burning skeleton’s melee attacks 
(including both those made with a natural weapon 
and those made with a manufactured weapon) deal an 
additional 1d6 points of fire damage.
Abilities: A burning skeleton’s Charisma is 12.
Special Qualities: A burning skeleton gains fiery death.
Fiery Death (Su): A burning skeleton explodes into a burst 
of f lame when it dies. Anyone adjacent to the skeleton 
when it is destroyed takes 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 
Hit Dice the skeleton possessed (minimum 1d6). A Ref lex 
save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skeleton’s Hit Dice + the skeleton’s 
Cha bonus) halves this damage.

Some skeletons retain their intelligence and 
cunning, making them formidable warriors. These 
undead are far more powerful than their mindless 
kin, and many gain class levels.
Creating a Skeletal Champion
“Skeletal Champion” is an acquired template 
that can be added to any corporeal 
creature (other than an undead) that has 
a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as 
the base creature) and a minimum 
Intelligence of 3.
CR: A skeletal champion’s 
CR is +1 higher than a normal 
skeleton with the same HD 
(see page 250).
Type: The creature’s 
type becomes undead. 
It keeps subtypes save for 
alignment subtypes and 
subtypes that indicate kind.
Alignment: Any evil.

Armor Class: Natural armor as per skeleton (see page 250).
Hit Dice: Change all of the creature’s racial HD to d8s, 
then add 2 racial Hit Dice to this total (creatures without 
racial HD gain 2). HD from class levels are unchanged.
Defensive Abilities: A skeletal champion gains DR 5/
bludgeoning, channel resistance +4, and immunity to 
cold. It also gains all of the standard undead traits.
Speed: As standard skeleton (see page 250).
Attacks: As standard skeleton (see page 250).
Abilities: Str +2, Dex +2. As undead, it has no 
Constitution score.
BAB: Its BAB for racial HD equals 3/4 of its HD.
Skills: Gains skill ranks per racial Hit Die equal to 4 
+ its Int modifier. Class skills for racial HD are Climb, 
Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge 
(religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth. 
Skills gained from class levels remain unchanged.
Feats: A skeletal champion gains Improved Initiative 
as a bonus feat.
Saves: Base save bonuses for racial Hit 
Dice are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, 
and Will +1/2 HD + 2.

Skum are the most prolific and successful of the countless 
races created by the aboleths to serve as slaves. At the height 
of the aboleth empire, skum were legion and their armies 
waged many wars upon the land, yet now that the aboleths 
are in decline, skum have been set loose to manage on 
their own.
For the most part, the skum have been less than 
successful at this endeavor, and today they exist in a 
shadow of their previous multitude, most of them 
dwelling deep underground in slowly crumbling 
ruins left standing only because their enemies have 
lost interest in pursuing the now-won war against 
these fish-like humanoids. Skum have even lost 
their own name—only the most erudite and wise 
of their kind remember that they were once 
known as the ulat-kini. Today, most identify 
themselves with the racial epithet applied to them by 
surface-dwellers—“skum.”

This hunchbacked, green-skinned humanoid has a wide, frog-like 
head but a mouth more akin to that of a toothy fish.

SSkkeelletal Champion–Skum

etal Champion–Skum

Skum do not age, and barring death by violence or 
disease, they can live forever. Unfortunately, this near 
immortality is crippled by the fact that skum are incapable 
of reproducing among themselves, for all skum are male. 
The aboleths did not want their slave race to prosper 
without their permission. Yet terribly, this does not 
mean that skum cannot breed. Originally created from 
human stock, skum can impregnate humans, and the 
children issued from such unholy unions are invariably 
deformed. Those who are not born skum undergo gradual 
transformations throughout their lives, and when they 
would normally die of old age, such hybrids instead go 
through “the change,” shedding their wrinkled f lesh and 
transforming into one of the ulat-kini. While most skum 
tribes lack the drive to perpetuate their race and would 
prefer to languish in their hideous sunken ruins, tribes 
settling offshore of remotely populated coastlines seem 
to be on the rise. Some such communities raid villages 
for breeding stock, but a few more insidious tribes form 
alliances with these desperate folk, providing protection 
and bounty from the sea in return for wives.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Spit Acid (Ex) A giant slug can spit acid at an opponent within 
60 feet (no range increment). With a successful ranged 
touch attack, the target takes 10d6 points of acid damage 
(no save).
Malleable (Ex) A giant slug’s body is very malleable, 
allowing it to fit into narrow areas with ease. 
A giant slug takes no penalty to its speed or 
checks when squeezing in an area that is one 
size category smaller than its actual size (10 feet 
wide for most giant slugs). A giant slug can 
squeeze normally through an area two size 
categories smaller than its actual size (5 
feet wide for most giant slugs).
Susceptible to Salt (Ex) A handful of salt burns 
a giant slug as if it were a flask of acid, 
causing 1d6 points of damage per use.
No simple garden pests, giant slugs 
pose a serious threat to those caught 
in their path. Folk who dwell near 
swamps and other regions that 
support giant slugs risk losing 
livestock and even their homes 

to these enormous beasts. Giant slugs constantly wander 
in search of food, their preference being f leshy organic 
material, which they slice into smaller, easily gulped 
chunks with their rasp-like tongues.
What strange inf luence might have caused the first 
giant slugs to grow to such monstrous proportions is 
unknown, but today, giant slugs breed true and birth their 
oversized offspring after a f leshy, squirming courtship 
ritual. After mating, a female giant slug lays just over a 
hundred eggs, each approximately a foot in diameter. The 
mother slug guards this clutch fiercely and aggressively 
attacks any creatures that wander too close. Giant slugs 
inhabiting swamps aboveground mate once a year, and 
those who live in the area know better than to go into the 
swamps during this month.
Deep below ground, some subterranean races use giant 
slugs as mounts or guardians. Creatures like mites, who 
have a strange empathy with vermin, can be used to keep 
giant slugs docile, but in most cases, those who would use 
giant slugs must do so with great care, keeping them well 
fed until they are needed for battle. Frightened whispers 
report armies of troglodytes using giant slugs as siege 
mounts. One particularly disturbing tale mentions a 
vast underground cavern inhabited by scores of skum 
and aboleth-controlled aquatic giant slugs with strange, 
mind-numbing abilities infused into their acidic saliva.

Be they jungle-dwelling pythons or swamp-

snakes are among the most deadly 
predatory animals of the tropical wilds. 
Fortunately, these large snakes are 
relatively passive, save for when they 
are preparing to shed their skins or 
are particularly hungry. Nevertheless, 
the sinuous creatures are held in fear by 
many societies who often ascribe fiendish 
qualities to them.
The constrictor snake presented

Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoids slain by a spectre 
become spectres themselves in 1d4 rounds. 
Spawn so created are less powerful than typical 
spectres, and suffer a –2 penalty on all d20 rolls 
and checks, receive –2 hp per HD, and only 
drain one level on a touch. Spawn are under the 
command of the spectre that created them and 
remain enslaved until its death, at which point they 
lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged 
and free-willed spectres. They do not possess any of 
the abilities they had in life.
Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell 
cast on a spectre destroys it (Will negates). Using the 
spell in this way does not require a material component.
Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) Spectres are powerless in natural 
sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. A 
spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, whether wild or 
domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of 

a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly 
approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so 
unless a master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, 
or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so as 
long as it is within 30 feet of the spectre.
Spectres are evil undead that hate sunlight and living 
things. Most are the remnants of murdered or evil humans, 
their anger preventing them from entering the afterlife. 
Like ghosts, spectres haunt the places of their deaths, and 
seek to draw others into the lonely abyss of undeath.
A spectre looks much as it did in life and can be easily 
recognized by those who knew the individual or have seen 
the individual’s face in paintings or drawings. Spectres 
retain a strong sense of identity, and even ancient, insane 
spectres generally remain coherent. Evil historians 
and necromancers often try to ally with spectres for the 
knowledge they held in life and retain in undeath.

Although there are many different species of sphinx, 
the one certain scholars refer to as the “gynosphinx” 
(a name many sphinxes find insulting) is a wise and 
majestic creature that is nevertheless terrifying when 
angered. Less moralistic than their male counterparts 
(the “androsphinx”—a different creature entirely than 
the sphinx presented here), sphinxes are careful and 
methodical in their decision-making, and pride 
themselves on their cold logic and impartiality. 
They have little patience for the lesser sphinx 
variants, seeing them as little better than 

Sphinx
This creature has the body of a lion, the wings of a falcon, and the 
head and torso of a beautiful human woman.

Spectre–Sphinx

animals. Sphinxes love riddles and complicated 
dilemmas, and treasure strange facts and arcane trivia 
far more than gold or gems
While not great scholars in any traditional sense, 
sphinxes’ great appreciation of puzzles leads them to 
research shallowly in a wide variety of subjects, and they 
can often be invaluable sources of information, especially 
when making use of their magical abilities. They are 
usually happy to barter with other races, and regularly 
trade material goods for information or new and 
interesting quandaries. They make excellent guardians 
for temples, tombs, and other important locations, so 
long as they are kept adequately entertained. Sphinxes 
place great value on politeness, but can be dangerously 
temperamental—while they may decide to share their 
latest riddles with travelers out of altruism, they think 
little of devouring those who don’t give their dilemmas 
adequate attention or provide useful insight.
Sphinxes are typically 10 feet long and about 800 
pounds. While their wings are capable of holding them 
aloft for long periods of time, they are poor f liers, and 
prefer to land before engaging foes, lashing out with their 
powerful claws. Though fiercely territorial, they tend to 
give intruders plenty of warning before attacking.

indeed—particularly when the swarm is made up of

like mandibles capable of lacerating f lesh with sickening 
ease. A swarm of spiders is a colonial mass of arachnids 
that relies on overwhelming much larger prey with sheer 
numbers rather than catching smaller snacks. While 
spider swarms spin webs, these webs are incapable of 
catching larger prey and typically serve the swarm as a 
lair rather than a method of capturing dinner.

A spider the size of a man crawls silently from the depths of its 
funnel-shaped web.

The giant squid is a legendary 
beast capable of feeding on 
humans with ease. Hunger 
has been known to drive 
these normally deep-
dwelling creatures up 
to the ocean surface 
where anything they 
encounter is potential 
prey. A giant squid is 45 
feet long and weighs 
1,500 pounds.

This slender red squid darts through the water with alacrity. Two 
large eyes stare from above the creature’s tentacles.

Immense in size, this great squid’s tentacles writhe and f lash with 
almost nauseating speed. The beast’s eyes are as big as shields.

Treasure none
SPECIAL ABILITIES
Attach (Ex) When a stirge hits with a touch attack, its barbed 
legs latch onto the target, anchoring it in place. An 
attached stirge is effectively grappling its prey. The stirge 
loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 12, but 
holds on with great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into 
the grappled target’s flesh. A stirge has a +8 racial bonus 
to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An 
attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled 
itself—if its prey manages to win a grapple check or 
Escape Artist check against it, the stirge is removed.
Blood Drain (Ex) A stirge drains blood at the end of 
its turn if it is attached to a foe, inflicting 1 point 
of Constitution damage. Once a stirge has dealt 4 
points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies 
off to digest the meal. If its victim dies before the 
stirge’s appetite has been sated, the stirge detaches 
and seeks a new target.
Diseased (Ex) Due to the stagnant swamps in which they live 
and their contact with the blood of numerous creatures, 
stirges are harbingers of disease. Any creature subjected 
to a stirge’s blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being 

exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease 
(Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, 
the victim can no longer be infected by this particular 
stirge, though attacks by different stirges are resolved 
normally and may result in multiple illnesses.
Stirges are vicious, blood-drinking swamp pests that prey 
on wild animals, livestock, and unwary travelers. While 
weak individually, swarms of the creatures are capable of 
draining a man dry in minutes, leaving only a desiccated 
husk in their wake. 
Closer to mammals than insects, stirges carry their 
bodies through the air on four f leshy wings, searching 
out warm-blooded prey. They are fond of hiding near 
watering holes and waiting for travelers to drop their 
guard, then swooping out to attach and drink their fill 
by thrusting their long feeding tubes into unprotected 
veins. After feeding they f lap heavily off into the mud and 
reeds to lay their eggs and rest until hunger drives them 
to hunt again.
Stirges are usually 1 foot long, with a wingspan of twice 
that, and weigh just under a pound. Their coloration is 
rust-red or reddish-brown with a dirty yellow underbelly, 
though stirges that have not fed in some time are often 
pale pink, their color deepening as they gorge.

This insectoid creature has two pairs of bat wings, a tangle of thin 
legs, and a needle-sharp proboscis.

Svirfneblin, or “deep gnomes,” are a 
reclusive offshoot of the gnome race. They 
dwell underground in hidden cities, safe 
from dark elves and other subterranean 

races. They have skin the color of gray or brown stone. Males 
are bald, and females have stringy gray hair. A svirfneblin’s 
ties to the eerie realm of the fey are much stronger than 
those of their surface-dwelling gnome kin, and this makes 
them either strangely detached from their emotions or 
violently random in their outbursts. Svirfneblin have long 
fought wars against the duergar, and have a difficult time 
seeing the difference between duergar and other dwarves.
Svirfneblin Characters
Svirfneblin are defined by their class levels—they do not 
possess racial Hit Dice. A svirfneblin’s CR is equal to his 
class level. Svirfneblin have the following racial traits.
–2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, –4 Charisma: 
Svirfneblin are fast and observant, but relatively weak 
and emotionally distant.
Small: Svirfneblin are Small creatures and gain a +1 
size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a –1 
penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on 
Stealth checks.
Defensive Training: Svirfneblin gain a +2 dodge bonus 
to Armor Class.
Senses: Svirfneblin have darkvision 120 ft. and low-
light vision.
Fortunate: Svirfneblin gain a +2 racial bonus on all 
saving throws.
Skilled: Svirfneblin gain a +2 racial bonus 
on Stealth checks; this improves to a +4 bonus 
underground. They gain a +2 racial bonus on 
Craft (alchemy) checks and Perception checks.
Hatred: Svirfneblin receive a +1 bonus on 
attack rolls against humanoid creatures of 
the reptilian and dwarven subtypes due 
to training against these hated foes.
Stonecunning: Svirfneblin gain 
stonecunning as a dwarf (Pathfinder 
RPG Core Rulebook 21).
Spell Resistance: Svirfneblin have 
SR equal to 11 + class levels.
Svirfneblin Magic: Svirfneblin 
add +1 to the DC of any illusion 
spells they cast. Svirfneblin 
also gain the spell-like abilities 
listed above; caster level equals the 
svirfneblin’s class levels.
Languages: Svirfneblin begin 
play speaking Gnome and 
Undercommon. Those with 
high Int scores can choose 
from the following bonus 
languages: Aklo, Common, 
Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, 
Giant, Goblin, Orc, or Terran.

This bald gnome has rocky gray skin and a wiry physique. Its pale 
eyes are overly large and expressive.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Carapace (Su) The tarrasque’s scales deflect 
cones, lines, rays, and magic missile spells, 
rendering the tarrasque immune to such 
effects. There is a 30% chance a deflected effect 
reflects back in full force at the caster; 
otherwise it is simply negated.
Powerful Leaper (Ex) The tarrasque 
uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics 
checks made to jump, and has a +24 

racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.
Regeneration (Ex) No form of attack can suppress the 
tarrasque’s regeneration—it regenerates even if 
disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If the tarrasque 
fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it 
rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further 
damage is inflicted upon its remains. It can be banished or 
otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but the 
method to truly kill it has yet to be discovered.
Rush (Ex) Once per minute for 1 round, the tarrasque can 
move at a speed of 150 feet. This increases its Acrobatics 
bonus on checks made to jump to +87.
Spines (Ex) The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like 
spines from its body as a standard action with a toss of 
its head or a lash of its tail. Make an attack roll for each 
spine—all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. 
The spines have a range increment of 120 ft.
The legendary tarrasque is among the world’s most 
destructive monsters. Thankfully, it spends most of its 
time in a deep torpor in an unknown cavern in a remote 
corner of the world—yet when it wakens, kingdoms die.
Although far from intelligent, the tarrasque is smart 
enough to understand a few words in Aklo (though it 
cannot speak). Likewise, it isn’t 
mindless in its rampages, but 
instead focuses on targets that 
threaten it, and is difficult to 
distract with trickery.

This immense reptilian beast towers over the surroundings like a 
dinosaur, all teeth and horns and claws and thrashing spiked tail.

Linguistics checks, and learn 2 languages each 
time they gain a rank in Linguistics rather than

Swordtrained (Ex) Tengus are trained from birth in swordplay, 
and as a result are automatically proficient with sword-like 
weapons (including bastard swords, daggers, elven curve 
blades, falchions, greatswords, kukris, longswords, punching 
daggers, rapiers, scimitars, short swords, and two-bladed 
swords).
Tengus are a race of avian humanoids that resemble 
crows or ravens, and often bear much of the same 
stigma. Though they frequently choose to live 
among other races in densely populated cities, 
their society is tight and closed, and 
they rarely allow others to see its inner 
workings. Tengus often band together 
in small groups to create roosts in vacant 

warehouses or condemned buildings, and these raucous 
gathering places are generally assumed to be thieves’ 
guilds by outsiders—an assumption that’s correct 
roughly half the time.
Like the crows they share physical traits with, tengus 
are naturally covetous, especially of shiny or colorful 
items, and prone to bouts of good-natured kleptomania 
if they don’t carefully keep themselves in check. Vain and 
prideful creatures, they are easily persuaded with f lattery.
Tengu Characters
Tengus are defined by their class levels—they do not 
possess racial Hit Dice. All tengus have the following 
racial traits.
+2 Dexterity, –2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom: Tengus are 
fast and observant, but relatively fragile and delicate.
Senses: Tengus have low-light vision.
Sneaky: Tengus gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception 
and Stealth.
Gifted Linguist: See above.
Swordtrained: See above.
Natural Weapon: Tengus possess a bite natural attack 
that inf licts 1d3 points of damage on a hit. This is a 
primary attack, or a secondary attack if the tengu wields 
a manufactured weapon.
Languages: Tengus begin play speaking Common and 
their own dialect of Tengu. Tengus with high Intelligence 
scores can choose any language as a bonus language.

Black feathers cover this crow-headed humanoid, and its hands 
and legs end in powerful talons.

Tigers stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are 
about 9 feet long. They weigh from 400 to 600 pounds.
Tigers are usually the top animal predators in their 
territories, and have been known to kill bears, crocodiles, 
giant snakes, wolves, and even other great cats. Even 
humanoids are far from safe, especially in cases where 
a tiger has developed a taste for humanoid f lesh. Tigers 
prefer terrain with plenty of cover and proximity to water 
as their hunting grounds.
While the tiger itself is a fearsome 
predator, its strength and ferocity pales in 
comparison to that of the larger dire tiger. 
Known to many scholars as the smilodon and 
to tribal societies as the saber-toothed tiger, 
the dire tiger is invariably one of the region’s top 
predators. Its defining feature is a pair of 
huge incisors that hang down like fearsome 
knives from the upper jaw, protruding 
menacingly even when the creature’s mouth 
is shut.
These immense hunting cats grow to 
be over 12 feet long and can weigh up to 
6,000 pounds.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Animate Trees (Sp) A treant 
can animate any trees 
within 180 feet at will, 
controlling up to two trees 
at a time. It takes 1 full round for a tree 
to uproot itself, after which it moves at a 
speed of 10 feet and fights as a 
treant (although it has only 

one slam attack and lacks the treant’s animation and rock-
throwing abilities), gaining the treant’s vulnerability to fire. If 
the treant that animated it terminates the animation, moves 
out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes 
root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.
Double Damage Against Objects (Ex) A treant or animated 
tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure 
deals double damage.
Treespeech (Ex) A treant has the ability to converse with plants 
as if subject to a continual speak with plants spell, and most 
plants greet them with an attitude of friendly or helpful.
Treants are guardians of the forest and speakers for 
the trees. As long-lived as the forests themselves, and 
seeing themselves as parents and shepherds rather than 
gardeners, treants are slow and methodical in most things 
but terrifying when forced to fight in defense of their 
f lock. Though they rarely seek out the companionship 
of the short-lived races, and have an inherent distrust of 
change, they have been known to tolerate those who seek 
to learn from their long, rambling monologues, especially 
if the pupils express a desire to help protect the 
wildlands. Yet against those who would threaten 
the forest, especially loggers who seek to harvest 
wood for lumber or those who try to clearcut 
a section of forest in order to build a fort or 
establish a town, the treants’ wrath 
is swift and devastating. They are 
particularly gifted at tearing down 
what others build—a trait that 
serves angry treants well.
Treants are primarily 
solitary creatures, with a 
given individual sometimes 
responsible for an entire 
forest, but they occasionally 
come together in small 
groups called groves to 
share news and reproduce. 
In times of grave danger, all 
of the groves in a region may 
gather for a great months-long 
meeting called a moot, but 
such events are exceedingly 
rare, and millennia may go by 
between them.
The typical treant is 30 
feet tall, with a trunk 2 feet 
in diameter, and weighs 
4,500 pounds. Treants tend to 
resemble the species of trees 
most common in their 
woodland territories.

This animated tree’s bark is knotted into vaguely humanoid 
features, with branches for arms and roots for legs.

The troglodyte is a feral, savage cave dweller. They are 
among the most populous denizens of the upper reaches 
of the endless caverns of the underworld, equally at 
home raiding the settlements of those who dwell above 
or below ground, yet for all their race’s fecundity and 
sprawl, as a whole they represent only a minor threat. At 
times, great leaders can draw legions of troglodytes to their 
command to create vast and deadly armies, but left to their 
own devices, troglodyte tribes are content to keep each 
other under control with numerous feuds, cannibalistic 
raids, and bitter civil wars.
The troglodyte is one of the oldest of intelligent races, 
and ruins found in some remote caverns testify to the 
fact that their empire was once among the largest 
in the world. At the dawn of time, the troglodyte 
civilization was generations ahead of other humanoid 

races—while those races hid in caves and worshiped 
fire, the troglodytes raised vast cities of stone ziggurats 
and twisting canals, kept other races as slaves, and 
worshiped ancient and inhuman gods and demons. 
Yet as the other races evolved and grew increasingly 
civilized, they outstripped their onetime troglodyte 
oppressors. Today, the roles have changed—now it is 
the troglodyte that hides in caves and lives the life of 
a feral savage.
Religion is strong among troglodyte tribes, and 
their shamans and priests are universally the highest 
regarded members of a clan. A troglodyte chieftain is 
not always a cleric or druid, but those who do not have 
divine power are usually mere mouthpieces and puppet 
lords that answer to the beck and call of the local seer 
or shaman. Troglodytes generally worship one of the 
countless demon lords, particularly those of a reptilian 
or primeval shape and form or those whose Abyssal 
domains most closely resemble the tangled caverns 
troglodytes prefer. Troglodyte druids are usually 
neutral evil if they dwell with their own kind (and are 
universally feared and respected for the eerie command 
they have over beasts).
A typical troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 
150 pounds.

This humanoid’s scaly hide is dull gray. Its frame resembles that 
of a cave lizard, with a long tail and crests on its head and back.

Trolls possess incredibly sharp claws and amazing 
regenerative powers, allowing them to recover from 
nearly any wound. They are stooped, fantastically ugly, 
and astonishingly strong—combined with their claws, 
their strength allows them to literally tear apart f lesh to 
feed their voracious appetites. Trolls stand about 14 feet 
tall, but their hunched postures often make them appear 
shorter. An adult troll weighs around 1,000 pounds.
A troll’s appetite and its regenerative powers make 
it a fearless combatant, ever prepared to charge 
headlong at the nearest living creature and 
attack with all of its fury. Only fire seems to 
cause a troll to hesitate, but even this mortal 
threat is not enough to stop a troll’s advance. 
Those who commonly battle with trolls 
know to locate and burn any pieces after a 
fight, for even the smallest scrap of f lesh 
can regrow a full-size troll given enough 
time. Fortunately, only the largest part of 
a troll regrows in this way.
Despite their cruelty in combat, trolls 
are surprisingly tender and kind to their own 
young. Female trolls work as a group, spending a 

This tall creature has rough, green hide. Its hands end in claws, 
and its bestial face has a hideous, tusked underbite.

great deal of time teaching young trolls to hunt and fend 
for themselves before sending them off to find their own 
territories. A male troll tends to live a solitary existence, 
partnering with a female for only a brief time to mate. All 
trolls spend most of their time hunting for food, as they 
must consume vast amounts each day or face starvation. 
Due to this need, most trolls stake out large territories as 
their own, and fights between rivals are quite common. 
While these are usually nonlethal, trolls are aware of each 
others’ weaknesses and will use such knowledge to kill 
their own kind if food is scarce.
Scrags
Dwelling in both fresh and salt water, these cousins of 
the troll have the aquatic subtype and the amphibious 
special quality. Scrags have a base land speed of 20 feet 
and a swim speed of 40 feet. A scrag’s regeneration ability 
only works if it is in contact with water. Scrags dwell in 
any body of water in any climate, though they are most 
common in cold northern rivers and lakes, and are 
less bestial in appearance 
than their terrestrial 
cousins, though 
no less violent.

TTrroollll––UUnniiccoorrnn

Unicorns are fierce, intelligent creatures of the forest, noble 
beasts who keep their own counsel and typically appear 
only to defend their homes against evil. They universally 
shun all creatures except for good-aligned fey, good-aligned 
humanoid women, and the woodlands’ native animals, 
though they may fight alongside other good creatures 
against common enemies. A typical unicorn is 8 feet long 
and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, weighing 1,200 pounds.
Unicorns mate for life, and the pairs generally make 
their homes in specific glades or dells within the vast 
forests they protect (these regions can cover anywhere 
from a few dozen square miles to hundreds). They allow 
good and neutral creatures to pass through, hunt for food, 
or reside in their woods unharmed, but evil creatures 
and those who damage the local ecosystem more than 
necessary through sport hunting or commercial logging 
are swiftly driven out or killed. On rare occasions, lone 
unicorns without mates or whose partners have been slain 
have been known to adopt young women of exceptionally 
pure virtue as surrogates, allowing the women to ride on 
their backs and becoming their guardians and protectors 
for life. This bond generally ends amiably if the woman 
becomes more committed to someone else—such as a 
lover or child—giving rise to the myth that unicorns only 
befriend virgins.
A unicorn’s horn is the focus for its powers, 
and in order to use its spell-like abilities on 
other creatures the unicorn must touch 
them with it. Evil creatures greatly value 
unicorn horns as reagents for healing 
potions and other dark rites, and a 
single powdered unicorn horn 
counts as 1,600 gp when used 
as a component for crafting 
healing magic.

Vampires are undead humanoid creatures that feed on 
the blood of the living. They look much as they did in 
life, often becoming more attractive, though some have a 
hardened, feral look instead.
Creating a Vampire
“Vampire” is an acquired template that can be added to 
any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to 
hereafter as the base creature). Most vampires were once 
humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vampire uses 
the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.
CR: Same as the base creature + 2.
AL: Any evil.
Type: The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). 
Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
Senses: A vampire gains darkvision 60 ft.
Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6.
Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class 
Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vampires use their 
Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points 
(instead of Constitution).
Defensive Abilities: A vampire gains channel resistance 
+4, DR 10/magic and silver, and resistance to cold 10 and 
electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities 
granted by the undead type. A vampire also gains fast 
healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire 
assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. 
It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly 
destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) 
Additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous 
form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It 
regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless 
and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.
Weaknesses: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of 
garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they 
recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. 
These things don’t harm the vampire—they merely keep 
it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away 
from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make 
melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at 
bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can 
overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally 
each round it makes a DC 25 Will save.
Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling 
unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so.
Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates 
it but doesn’t always destroy it (see fast healing). However, 
certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to 
direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure 
and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of 
exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in 
running water inf licts damage on a vampire equal to one-
third of its maximum hit points—a vampire reduced to 0

hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden 
stake through a helpless vampire’s heart instantly slays it 
(this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if 
the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and 
anointed with holy water.
Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature 
has a swim speed, the vampire is not unduly harmed by 
running water.
Melee: A vampire gains a slam attack if the base 
creature didn’t have one. Damage for the slam depends 
on the vampire’s size (see pages 301–302). Its slam also 
causes energy drain (see below). Its natural weapons are 
treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming 
damage reduction.
Special Attacks: A vampire gains several special attacks. 
Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 vampire’s HD + vampire’s 
Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.
Blood Drain (Su): A vampire can suck blood 
from a grappled opponent; if the vampire 
establishes or maintains a pin, it 
drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of 
Constitution damage. The vampire 
heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary 
hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum 
number of temporary hit points equal 
to its full normal hit points) each 
round it drains blood.
Children of the Night (Su): Once per 
day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 
1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard 
action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this 
power might summon other creatures of similar 
power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and 
serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.
Create Spawn (Su): A vampire can create spawn 
out of those it slays with blood drain or energy 
drain, provided that the slain creature is of 
the same creature type as the vampire’s base 
creature type. The victim rises from death as 
a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under 
the command of the vampire that created 
it, and remains enslaved until its master’s 
destruction. A vampire may have enslaved 
spawn totaling no more than twice its own 
Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would 
exceed this limit become free-willed undead. 
A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in 
order to enslave a new spawn, but once 
freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot 
be enslaved again.
Dominate (Su): A vampire can crush 
a humanoid opponent’s will as a 
standard action. Anyone the 

vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly 
under the vampire’s influence, as though by a dominate 
person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 
feet. At the GM’s discretion, some vampires might be able to 
affect different creature types with this power.
Energy Drain (Su): A creature hit by a vampire’s slam 
(or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels. This 
ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the 
number of attacks a vampire makes.
Special Qualities: A vampire gains the following.
Change Shape (Su): A vampire can use change shape to 
assume the form of a dire bat or wolf, as beast shape II. 
Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, a vampire can 
assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can

SPECIAL ABILITIES
kiss (Su) A vargouille can kiss a helpless 
target by making a successful melee 
touch attack (this provokes attacks of opportunity). A 
kissed opponent must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude 
save or begin a terrible transformation that changes 
the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often 
much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the 
transformation). First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all 
the victim’s hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours 
thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles 
sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, 
pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim 
takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 
point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation 
is complete 1d6 hours thereafter, when the victim’s 
head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and 
becomes a vargouille. This transformation’s progress 
is paused by sunlight or any light spell of 3rd level or 
higher, but stopping the transformation requires remove 
disease or a similar effect. The transformation is a disease 

effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a 
+4 racial bonus.
Poison (Su) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency once; 
effect damage caused by bite can only be healed with magic 
if the spellcaster succeeds on a DC 20 caster level check; 
cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Shriek (Su) Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its 
distended mouth to shriek. Those within 60 feet (except 
other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see 
the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or 
be paralyzed for 
2d4 rounds or until 
the monster attacks 
them, goes out of range, or 
leaves their sight. A creature 
that successfully saves cannot 
be affected again by the same 
vargouille’s shriek for 24 hours. 
The save DC is Constitution-based.
A vargouille is larger than 
a human head, typically 
between 12 and 20 inches 
high with a 15- to 35-inch 
wing span. Vargouilles are not 
natives of the Material Plane 
but can often be found there 
nevertheless, occupying graveyards, 
ancient battlefields, or anywhere one 
can find remnants of death and decay. 
These hideous monsters come from the 
fiendish outer planes, where they f lop and 
f lap through strange and haunted skies in 
constant search of fresh souls to torment. In 
these nightmare realms, vargouilles play a role 
similar to that of a raven or vulture, although they 
augment these roles with a malevolent delight in 
causing pain and anguish that no scavenger bird 
could ever hope to match.
Vargouilles attack by swooping in on their opponents, 
shrieking them into paralysis, and then biting them with 
rows of razor-sharp teeth. When multiple vargouilles 
take up a common cause and fight as allies, they 
overwhelm their victim with bites and shrieks, tearing 
it to shreds.
A vargouille’s low power and hideous method of 
reproduction make for a dangerous combination. 
Vargouilles are relatively easy to summon to the Material 
Plane, and once here, they can swiftly reproduce, creating 
more and more of their hideous kind from those who fall 
victim to their kiss. Vargouilles created on the Material 
Plane in this manner are still extraplanar creatures, and 
as such can be banished with the right magic.

Vegepygmys 
are created by a 
dangerous fungus 
known as russet mold—
creatures slain by russet 
mold serve as incubators 
for the mold’s spores, 
and a day later, the dead body 
bursts to release 1d6 fully grown 
vegepygmys. A vegepygmy has no 
real relation to the body from which 
it emerges, but the creature may yet 
retain a strange sort of reverence 
for its “birth corpse” and carry with 
it a grisly memento from the body, 
typically a few bones or teeth. Often, a 
vegepygmy uses such bones to craft a 
crude spear or some other weapon.

Vegepygmy
Short, thin, and green, this small humanoid wields a spear. 
Tendrils of fungus dangle from its arms, midsection, and legs.

VVaarrggoouuiilllle–Vegepygmy

e–Vegepygmy

Vegepygmy tribes live in tightly knit communities and 
fiercely guard their patches of russet mold. Vegepygmies 
cannot speak—they communicate via a crude language 
of rhythmic taps, beats, and clicks. Hunting parties 
echo these exchanges through the caves they travel. 
Vegepygmies stand 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 15 
to 45 pounds.
Approximately 1 in 20 vegepymies are chieftains. A 
vegepygmy chieftain is an advanced vegepygmy (often 
one with class levels) that carries an infestation of russet 
mold spores in its f lesh. A vegepygmy chieftain infects 
any creature it hits with its natural weapons with russet 
mold spores (see below).
Russet Mold (CR 6)
This hazardous fungus can be found in dark, wet areas, 
and often grows in great abundance at the heart of a 
vegepygmy lair. When a creature approaches within 5 feet 
of a patch of russet mold, the fungus releases a cloud of 
spores in a 5-foot radius burst. Everyone in the area must 
make a DC 15 Fortitude save or the spores quickly take 
root in their victims, inf licting 2 points of Constitution 
damage per round. A new Fortitude save can be attempted 
each round to halt the growth. Although immunity to 
disease won’t protect against russet mold spores, the 
growth can be halted by remove disease and similar effects. 
Exposure to sunlight also halts the spores’ growth. 
Plants are immune to russet mold spores.
After 24 hours, a fully grown vegepygmy bursts 
from the body of any creature slain by 
russet mold, provided the creature 
was Small or larger. For each size 
category 
larger than 
Small, 
the body 
produces 
one additional 
vegepygmy.
A patch of 
russet mold is 
unharmed by all 
effects save for acid, 
alcohol, or remove disease  (or 
a similar magical effect, 
such as heal), all of which 
can kill a single patch of 
russet mold on contact. 
Sunlight doesn’t kill 
the mold, but does 
render it dormant and 
harmless as long as the 
sunlight persists. 273

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Rot (Ex) A creature struck by a 
violet fungus’s 
tentacle 
must 
succeed on 
a DC 15 Fortitude 
save or the flesh 
around the point of 
contact swiftly begins to 
rot away, exposing raw bone with shocking 
swiftness. This hideous affliction causes 1d4 
points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of 
Constitution damage. This is a poison effect. 
The save DC is Constitution-based.
The violet fungus is one of the most notorious and 
feared dangers of the world’s caves. A traveler can 
often see signs of the violet fungus in those who dwell or 
hunt in places where these carnivorous fungi lurk. In 
these folk, deep and hideous scars mar bodies where 
entire furrows of f lesh seem scooped away—the 
marks of a close encounter with a violet fungus.
A violet fungus feeds on the rot and decay of 
organic matter, but unlike most fungi, they 
are not passive consumers of corruption. 
A violet fungi’s tendrils can strike with 

This mushroom grows from a bed of tentacular roots. Deep violet 
tendrils slither out of the dozens of fissures in its pointed cap.

unexpected swiftness, and are coated with a virulent 
venom that causes f lesh to rot and decay with nauseating 
speed. This potent poison, if left untreated, can cause 
the f lesh of an entire arm or leg to drop away in no time 
at all, leaving behind only warm bones that soon rot into 
corruption as well.
Although violet fungi are mobile, they only move 
to attack or to hunt for prey. A violet fungus that has 
a steady supply of rot to sup upon is generally content 
to remain in one place. Many underground-dwelling 
cultures take advantage of this penchant, particularly 
troglodytes and vegepygmies, and keep multiple violet 
fungi in key junctions and entrances to their caverns 
as guardians, making sure to keep them well fed with 
carrion to prevent them wandering farther into the den 
in search of food.
Some species of shriekers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 
416) are relatively similar in appearance to violet fungi, 
although they lack the tentacular branches. It’s not 
uncommon to find shriekers and violet fungi growing in the 
same grove—especially in areas where other 
creatures cultivate the fungi as guardians.
A violet fungus is 4 feet tall and weighs 
50 pounds.
Violet Venom
Although a violet fungus’s tentacles 
swiftly grow inert after the 
mushroom is slain, they can be 
wielded as Medium-sized whips 
for 2d6 minutes after being 
harvested from the creature. 
These whips inf lict rot on anything 
they touch—including the wielder of 
the deadly weapon—and both save 
DCs to resist and effects are identical 
to the stats presented above.
A DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check 
and 250 gp worth of reagents can 
preserve the venom somewhat, 
although the procedure dilutes it 
significantly.

Giant wasps nearly always form nests, though not like 
their much smaller cousins. Each nest functions with 
one leader (the queen), a few workers, and several soldiers. 
The workers and the queen produce offspring while the 
soldiers protect the nest and hunt for food. Giant wasp 
nests are typically found in caves, abandoned houses, 
or any complex large enough to fit a dozen 10-foot- 
tall insects.
Giant wasps attack when hungry or threatened, stinging 
their prey to death. They take dead or incapacitated 
opponents back to their lairs as food for their unhatched 
young—the experience of lying in a wasp nest, paralyzed 
while its grubs feed, is one of nature’s cruelest inventions. 
Even when part of a nest, giant wasps tend toward solitary 
hunting, and it’s rare to see more than one at a time.

A wasp swarm is a f lying mass of thousands of carnivorous 
wasps. In such large numbers, they become voracious 
hunters, capable of taking down large creatures with 
their venom-filled stings. While a wasp swarm is capable 
of inf licting hundreds of stings, its true danger arises 
from its insatiable appetite for meat.
Wasp swarms surround and attack any living prey in 
their paths, and are swift to seek out new prey once their 
anger is aroused. An enraged wasp swarm often loses 
track of its hive or the original source of its anger, and 
presented with a constant series of new targets to swarm 
and sting, a swarm can continue its rampage nonstop 
until it is destroyed or dispersed.

This horse-sized wasp is covered in yellow and black vertical 
stripes—its stinger is the size of a sword and drips with venom.

A low, ominous buzz announces the arrival of a mass of many 
thousands of angry, stinging wasps.

Create Spawn (Su) Any 
humanoid creature 
that is slain by a wight 
becomes a wight itself in 
only 1d4 rounds. Spawn so 
created are less powerful 
than typical wights, and 
suffer a –2 penalty on all 
d20 rolls and checks, as well 
as –2 hp per HD. Spawn are 
under the command of the wight 
that created them and remain 
enslaved until its death, at which 
point they lose their spawn 
penalties and become full-
fledged and free-willed wights. 
They do not possess any of 
the abilities they had in life.

Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell 
cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in 
this way does not require a material component.
Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to 
necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent 
personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil 
undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the 
corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to 
those who knew them in life; their f lesh is twisted by evil 
and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth 
become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap 
between a ghoul and a spectre—a warped animated corpse 
whose touch steals living energy.
As undead, wights do not need to breathe, so they 
are sometimes found underwater, though they are not 
particularly good swimmers unless they were originally 
swimming creatures such as aquatic elves or merfolk. 
Underwater wights prefer low-ceilinged 
caves where their limited swimming 
isn’t as much of a liability.
The wight presented here is a typical 
example of its kind, but sometimes when 
a wight creates spawn from particularly 
unusual humanoids, the resulting wights 
are quite different in power, such as the 
following three variants.
Brute Wight (CR 5): Giants that are 
killed by wights become hunchbacked, 
simple-minded undead. Brute wights 
are giant advanced wights, but 
cannot create spawn of their own.
Cairn Wight (CR 4): Some societies 
deliberately create these specialized 
wights to serve as guardians for 
barrows or other burial sites. A cairn 
wight is an advanced wight that fights 
with a weapon, typically a sword, that 
channels its energy drain attack and 
affects creatures damaged by the 
weapon as if they had been struck by 
the wight’s slam attack.
Frost Wight (CR 4): Wights 
created in cold environments 
sometimes become pale undead 
with blue-white eyes and ice in 
their hair. Frost wights have the cold 
subtype and their slam attacks deal 
1d6 cold damage in addition to the 
normal effects. A creature touching 
a frost wight with natural weapons 
or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 
cold damage.

The f lesh of this walking corpse is rotting and putrid, its body 
skeletal in places and its eye sockets glowing with red light.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
feed on fear (Su) Any time a will-o’-wisp is within 15 feet of a 
dying creature or creature subject to a fear effect, it gains 
fast healing 5.
Immunity to Magic (Ex) Will-o’-wisps are immune to all spells 
and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except 
magic missile and maze.
natural Invisibility (Ex) Will-o’-wisps have the ability to 
extinguish their natural glow as a move action, effectively 
becoming invisible, as per the spell.
Every trapper and bog farmer living near marshes or 
swamps has his own name for these faintly glowing balls 
of light—jack o’ the lanterns, corpse candles, walking 
fires, pine lights, spooklights, rushlights—but all 
recognize them as dangerous predators and false guides 
in the darkness.

Evil creatures that feed on the strong psychic 
emanations of terrified creatures, will-o’-wisps delight in 
tempting gullible travelers into dangerous situations. In 
the wild lands where they’re most common, will-o’-wisps 
favor simple tactics like positioning themselves over 
cliffs or quicksand where they can easily be mistaken for 
lanterns (especially if they can set their traps near actual 
signal lanterns), allowing them to lure unwary travelers 
into perilous situations. On rare occasions, will-o’-
wisps seeking easier pickings will move into a city and 
take up residence near gallows or follow along 
invisibly behind an army in order to harvest 
the fear of the dying men; why the vast 
majority choose to remain in the 
swamps where victims are scarce 
remains a mystery. Will-o’-
wisps only use their electric 
shock ability under extreme 
duress, preferring to let other 
creatures or hazards claim 
their victims while they f loat 
nearby and feast.
Will-o’-wisps can glow any 
color they choose, but are most 
frequently yellow, white, 
green, or blue. They can 
even vary their luminosity to 
create patterns—many will-o’-
wisps are fond of creating vague 
skull-like shapes in their glow 
to further terrify their victims. 
Their actual bodies are barely 
visible globes of translucent spongy 
material 1 foot across and weighing 3 
pounds, capable of emitting light from every surface. 
A will-o’-wisp’s light is approximately as bright as a 
torch, and though they do not seem to use sound to 
communicate with each other, they hear perfectly and 
can vibrate their bodies rapidly to simulate speech.
While vilified by most other sentient creatures, 
will-o’-wisps are actually quite intelligent, if utterly 
alien in their reasoning. Sometimes organized into 
groups called “strings,” their society and goals remain 
complete unknowns to outsiders, as do their origins, 
though they have sometimes been known to strike 
bargains with those who can offer them vast quantities 
of appropriately frightened victims. As will-o’-wisps do 
not age, and are effectively immortal unless killed by 
violence, particularly ancient will-o’-wisps can serve 
as fantastic repositories of knowledge from the ancient 
past, although convincing one of these cruel creatures 
to cooperate with an interrogation can be a trick in and 
of itself.  

This faintly glowing ball of light bobs gently in the air, the nebulous 
image of what might be a skull visible somewhere in its depths.

Wandering alone or in packs, 
wolves sit at the top of the food 
chain. Ferociously territorial 
and exceptionally wide-

wolf packs cover broad

contain slight webbing

assists in moving over 
snow, and its fur is a

ranging in color from gray 
to brown and even black in

An enormous version 
of a normal wolf, dire 
wolves represent the 
wolf in its most primal 
form. These creatures 
follow the same basic 
behaviors of regular 
wolves, but are much 
more aggressive. Dire 
wolves often serve 
giants as hunting 
companions and vicious 
guard animals. Some 
ferocious humanoids 
and woodsmen use 
trained dire wolves 
as mounts. Darker 
than normal wolves, 
dire wolves’ coats tend 
toward blacks and deep 
mottled grays. An adult 
dire wolf is typically about 
9 feet long and weighs 
roughly 800 pounds.

This powerful canine watches its prey with piercing yellow eyes, 
darting its tongue across sharp white teeth.

This immense black wolf is the size of a horse, its fangs as large 
and sharp as knives.

Wolverines are territorial,

known to defend their 
kills against much 
larger predators, 
such as black 
bears. They 
are fearsome  
opponents, 
launching 
into a frenzy 
when wounded. They tend to give off a very 
strong, unpleasant musk smell when angry.
Armed with powerful jaws, strong legs, and a thick 
hide, wolverines are remarkably strong for their size. 
They are reckless in battle and throw themselves at their 
foes, clawing and biting furiously.

Worgs are oversized, evil, intelligent wolves often found 
dwelling amid goblins or other savage races. A typical 
worg has gray or black fur, stands 3 feet tall at the 
shoulder, and weighs 300 pounds.
Worgs hunt in packs, running down and 
surrounding their prey like common wolves, 
but their intelligence and 
ability to speak make them 
better at coordinating 
their attacks. They 
sometimes use one 
packmate as a decoy, 
pretending to be a 
humanoid calling 
for help in order to 
lure intelligent prey 
into an ambush. Worgs 
that travel with goblins 
often allow them to ride 
on their backs, but in 
such situations it is 
usually the worg that 
is the master, not 
the rider.

Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid slain by a wraith 
becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. These spawn 
are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a 
–2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive –2 hp 
per HD, and only drain 1d2 points of Constitution 
on a touch. Spawn are under the command 
of the wraith that created them until its 
death, at which point they lose their 
spawn penalties and become free-willed 
wraiths. They do not possess any of the 
abilities they had in life.
Constitution Drain (Su) Creatures hit by a 
wraith’s touch attack must succeed on a 
DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points 
of Constitution drain. On each successful 
attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit 
points. The save DC is Charisma-based. 
Lifesense (Su) A wraith notices and locates 
living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it 
possessed the blindsight ability.

Wraiths are undead creatures born of evil and darkness. 
They hate light and living things, as they have lost much

Dread Wraith
A wraith that exists for long enough and feeds on enough 
life force undergoes an unholy transformation, becoming 
a creature known as a dread wraith. This causes the wraith

negative energy damage and 1d8 Constitution drain with 
its incorporeal touch. You can create a dread wraith by

Wyverns are nasty, brutish, and violent reptilian 
beasts akin to more powerful dragons. They are always 
aggressive and impatient, and are quick to resort to 
force in order to accomplish their goals. For this reason, 
dragons generally look down upon wyverns, considering 
their distant cousins nothing more than primitive 
savages with a distinct lack of style or wit. In most 
cases, this generalization is spot-on. Although far from 
animalistic in intellect, and capable of speech, most 
wyverns simply can’t be bothered with the subtlety of 
diplomacy, and prefer to fight first and parley later, and 
even then only if faced with a foe they can neither defeat 
nor f lee from.

Wyverns are territorial creatures. Though they 
occasionally hunt in small groups for large prey, they are 
generally solitary creatures, hunting in areas ranging in 
size from 100 to 200 square miles. Wyverns have been 
known to fight to the death among themselves for the 
right to hunt a territory rich with prey.
Although constantly hungry and prone to mayhem, a 
wyvern that can be befriended (usually through a delicate 
combination of f lattery, intimidation, food, and treasure) 
becomes a powerful ally. They often serve giants and 
monstrous humanoids as guardians, and some lizardfolk 
and boggard tribes even use them as mounts, although 
such arrangements are quite costly in terms of food and 
gold, for few are the wyverns who would willingly serve as 
steeds for lesser creatures for long.
A wyvern is about 16 feet in length, half of which is 
tail. The average wyvern weighs 2,000 pounds.

A dark blue dragon, its wings immense and its tail tipped with a 
hooked stinger, lands on two taloned feet and roars a challenge.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Implant (Ex) As a standard action, a xill can lay 2d6 eggs in a 
helpless creature. A xill’s eggs hatch in 24 hours, at which 
point the young consume the host from within, inflicting 
1 point of Con damage per hour per young until the host 
dies. The young then emerge and planewalk to the Ethereal 
Plane, if possible, to mature. A remove disease spell (or 
similar effect) rids a victim of all implanted eggs or active 
young, or they can be cut out one at a time with DC 20 Heal 
checks (each attempt takes 10 minutes). If a check fails, the 
healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 
1d4 points of damage to the patient. 
Multiweapon Mastery (Ex) A xill never takes penalties to an 
attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons, and treats 
claws as primary attacks even when also wielding weapons.
Planewalk (Su) A xill can shift from the Ethereal Plane to 
the Material Plane as a move action. Shifting from the 

Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane takes 2 consecutive 
full-round actions, during which time the xill is immobile. 
As a xill fades away, it becomes harder to hit: opponents 
have a 20% miss chance in the first round and a 50% miss 
chance in the second. A xill can take a single willing or 
helpless creature with it when it switches planes.
Xills are the scourge of the Ethereal Plane, conquering 
everything in their paths with only one purpose: to 
perpetuate their race at the expense of others. All xills 
are female and capable of fertilizing their own eggs, but 
require living hosts to incubate these eggs, which they 
inject into paralyzed victims by means of a grotesque 
ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles. 
Evil and alien, the plane-shifting xills possess impressive 
intelligence and a totalitarian, militaristic culture all their 
own. Though they see most other life forms as incubators, 
they particularly prize phase spiders for this purpose.

This f lame-red humanoid appears to be a strange mix of insect 
and reptile, with four arms and twitching, fanged mandibles.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
All-Around Vision (Ex) A xorn sees in all directions 
at the same time, giving it a +4 racial bonus on 
Perception checks. A xorn cannot be flanked.
Earth glide (Ex) A xorn can glide through any 
sort of natural 
earth or stone 
as easily as a fish 
swims through 
water. Its burrowing 
leaves no sign of its 
passage nor hint at its 
presence to creatures 
that don’t possess 
tremorsense. A move 
earth spell cast on an 
area containing a xorn 
moves the xorn back 30 
feet, stunning the creature 
for 1 round unless it 
succeeds on a DC 15 
Fortitude save.

Strange creatures as big around as they are tall, xorns 
have little interest in natives of the Material Plane—
except for the gems and precious metals they might 
be carrying. Lurking beneath the surface for what 
might seem long stretches of time to humans, a xorn 
might wait months, even years, for the right treat to come 
along, assaulting the being carrying its favorite meal, 
such as a certain gemstone or the right sort of silver. 
Adventurers who frequent regions inhabited by xorns 
often carry with them small chunks of raw ore or 
relatively inexpensive gemstones or crystals to use as 
bribes. While the price of a gemstone or piece of metal 
is often in direct proportion to the object’s f lavor and 
desirability as a meal, most xorns are quite gluttonous 
and prefer quantity over quality when it comes to food
Treasure found carried by a xorn or stashed in its 
lair amounts to little more than snacks set aside for 
another day. An offering of a particularly delicious (and 
expensive) jewel or piece of precious metal can swiftly 
secure a xorn’s temporary allegiance. Since xorns can 
swim through solid rock with ease, they make excellent 
guides in underground regions.
Xorns grow in size as they age. The youngest xorns 
are approximately 3 feet in size, and can be represented 
by applying the young simple template to the statistics 
presented here. The most commonly encountered xorns 
are about 5 feet tall (and wide), while the largest are 8 feet 
or more and weigh upward of 9,000 pounds. These elder 
xorns are giant advanced xorns, but some even greater 
xorns exist as well, with upward of 15 Hit Dice.
Often, an elder xorn possesses class levels as well. 
These creatures are generally leaders, heroes, or 
even outcasts or villains in xorn society. A classed 
elder xorn typically has levels 
in barbarian or rogue. 
Xorns aren’t particularly 
religious, but those who 
do have deep faith are 
typically druids (though such 
xorns rarely, if ever, take 
animal companions, as such 
followers cannot follow through 
solid rock, and  instead 
choose to take the Earth 
domain). Xorn bards 
and sorcerers are not 
unheard of either, with 
bards favoring Perform 
(sing) as their focus, 
and sorcerers almost 
invariably having 
the Elemental 
(earth) bloodline. 

This squat beast is as wide as it is tall. Strangely symmetrical, it 
has three arms, three legs, three eyes, and one huge mouth.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Create yellow Musk zombie (Su) As a full-round action, a 
yellow musk creeper can bore dozens of tendrils into 
the brain of a helpless creature within reach, such as a 
creature entranced by its pollen. This attack inflicts 
1d4 points of Intelligence damage per round. When a 
creature is reduced to 0 Intelligence, it dies, and the 
tendrils break off inside its brain. One hour later, the 
creature animates as a yellow musk zombie (see below).
Pollen Spray (Ex) As a standard action, a yellow musk 
creeper can spray a cloud of pollen at a single creature 
within 30 feet. It must make a +4 ranged touch attack 
to strike the target, who must then succeed on a DC 
14 Will save or be entranced for 1d6 rounds. An 
entranced creature can take no action other than 
to move at its normal speed into a space within 
the yellow musk creeper’s reach, at which point an 
entranced creature remains motionless and allows 
the creeper to insert tendrils into its brain. The save 
DC is Constitution-based.
The yellow musk creeper is a hideous plant that 
grows in haunted graveyards, grisly battlefields, 
and other places where death hangs heavy in the 
air and thick in the soil. The yellow musk creeper’s 
method of procreation is singularly frightful—it 
slays the living, infests them with its seeds and 

Coiling around several human skeletons, this wet green plant’s

pollen, then animates them as zombies. These zombies 
serve the plant as a guardian for several days, but when 
new zombies are created, older ones wander off into the 
surrounding wild, collapsing and breaking apart within 
2d6 days to give seed to a new yellow musk creeper.
Yellow Musk Zombie
A yellow musk zombie is a rotting creature from which wet 
green vines have sprouted. Treat a yellow musk zombie as 
a standard zombie, but with this special quality.
Plant Traits (Ex) This zombie’s animation is provided 
not by necromancy but by the plant that grows throughout 
its body. Yellow musk zombies lack undead traits, but gain 
plant traits. They are treated as plants, not undead, for the 
resolution of magical effects and attacks. Channel energy 
cannot harm a yellow musk zombie, for example, nor does 
negative energy heal a yellow musk zombie.

Bay (Su) When a yeth hound howls or barks, 
all creatures except other evil outsiders 
within a 300-foot spread must 
succeed on a DC 12 Will save 
or become panicked for 2d4 
rounds. This is a sonic mind-
affecting fear effect. Whether 
or not the save is successful, 
an affected creature is 
immune to the same hound’s 
bay for 24 hours. The save DC 
is Charisma-based.
flight (Su) A yeth hound can 
cease or resume its flight as a 
free action.
Sinister Bite (Su) A yeth hound’s 
bite is treated as evil-aligned 
for the purpose of overcoming 
damage reduction. In 
addition, a good-aligned 
creature bitten by a yeth 
hound must make a DC 14 Will 
save or be shaken for 1 round. If the 
victim is already suffering from a fear 

effect (such as the hound’s bay attack), the victim is instead 
completely overcome with fear and can do nothing but 
cower for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The 
save DC is Constitution-based.
Yeth hounds are evil outsiders that delight in hunting 
intelligent prey. They lope through the night skies, relentlessly 
pursuing their chosen quarry for miles, and harrying them 
with their frightful baying. Yeth hounds hunt only at night. 
They fear the sun and never venture out in daylight, even if 
their lives depend on it. A yeth hound stands 4 feet tall at the 
shoulder and weighs about 400 pounds.
Yeth hounds do not collect treasure, having no use for 
such baubles. The thrill of the hunt and the sweet tang of 
fear in their prey is all they value. However, some items 
of worth may occasionally be found in a yeth hound den, 
the discarded remnants of prey dragged back to the lair. 
Despite their bestial appearance, the yeth hound is rather 
intelligent, even if it does little with its intellect but 
devise and carry out ingenious, hateful plans to torment 
and horrify its prey before it finally strikes.
Yeth hounds can often be found in the company of 
night hags or evil hunters. Yeth hounds hate other 
canine monsters such as barghests and worgs, and attack  
them on sight if they have the advantage of numbers. They 
are often associated with particularly bestial demons, 
and can be found serving demon cults as 
guardians and trackers. A gift of a yeth hound 
companion to a particularly successful 
cult is sure sign of favor in the eyes 
of a demonic patron. A cult with 
yeth hounds granted to them 
in this manner must take 
care to retain this favor, for if 
they displease their demonic 
patron, the hounds could 
turn on them.
Yeth hounds inhabit 
secluded dens in 
remote wilderness areas 
far from bothersome 
civilization. These dens are 
always subterranean, far 
removed from the hated 
sunlight. Yeth hounds range 
great distances from their dens 
during their nightly hunts, and 
have been known to carry kills 
for miles just for the comfort of 
consuming a fresh meal in their lair. 
The sight of a yeth hound loping through 
the sky with a body clenched in its jaws is 
unsettling indeed.

Cold (Su) A yeti’s body 
generates intense cold, 
dealing 1d6 points of 
cold damage to any 
creature that contacts 
it with a natural attack 
or unarmed strike, or 
whenever it hits a foe with 
its claws or rend attack.
frightful gaze (Su) 
Creatures within 30 feet 
that meet a yeti’s gaze 
must succeed on a DC 13 
Will save or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. 
This is a mind-affecting fear paralysis effect. 
A creature that successfully saves cannot be 
affected again by the frightful gaze of that yeti for 1 
day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Mysterious and rarely seen (save by victims), the yeti is a 
towering denizen of the loneliest and tallest mountain 
peaks. Those who dwell upon the lower reaches of such 
storied slopes whisper tales of “abominable snowmen” who 
come down from the heights to raid, taking livestock or 
even humans as prey and leaving behind only monstrous 
barefoot tracks in the bloodstained snow.
Although yeti stories are accurate in their portrayals 
of fierce, stealthy, and immensely strong creatures, they 
are not when it comes to ascribing the yeti’s temperament 
and source. They dwell in small tribes atop their distant 
mountains, where they are sheltered from contact with 
most other races. Those with violent or cruel natures are 
usually forced out of tribes to live lonely lives as exiles, and 
without the support of a tribe such yeti are often driven 
to raiding lowlander settlements, thus perpetuating the 
myth of the yeti as a demon made f lesh.
The source of such cruel madness can often be traced 
to a singular source—proximity to strange, eldritch 
dimensions. The yetis’ mountain lairs rise high in places 
where the boundaries between this world and others 
rasp thin. It is unclear if the yeti are invaders from these 
dimensions or Material Plane natives inf luenced by 
otherworldly realms, but it seems certain that whatever 
their origins, the yeti are no friends to those who dwell 
beyond, and may even act as guardians 
against intrusions from such 
strange worlds into the 
Material Plane.

This creature stands like a man, yet is half again the height of 
most men and covered with a coat of thick white fur.

Zombies are the animated corpses of dead creatures, 
forced into foul unlife via necromantic magic like animate 
dead. While the most commonly encountered zombies are 
slow and tough, others possess a variety of traits, allowing 
them to spread disease or move with increased speed.
Zombies are unthinking automatons, and can do 
little more than follow orders. When left unattended, 
zombies tend to mill about in search of living creatures 
to slaughter and devour. Zombies attack until destroyed, 
having no regard for their own safety.
Although capable of following orders, zombies are 
more often unleashed into an area with no command 
other than to kill living creatures. As a result, zombies 
are often encountered in packs, wandering around places 
the living frequent, looking for victims. Most zombies 
are created using animate dead. Such zombies are always 
of the standard type, unless the creator also casts haste 
or remove paralysis to create fast zombies, or contagion to 
create plague zombies.
Creating a Zombie
“Zombie” is an acquired template that can be added to 
any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred 
to hereafter as the base creature.
Challenge Rating: This depends on the creature’s new 
total number of Hit Dice, as follows:

hD CR XP
1/2 1/8 50
1 1/4 100
2 1/2 200
3–4 1 400
5–6 2 600
7–8 3 800
9–10 4 1,200
11–12 5 1,600
13–16 6 2,400
17–20 7 3,200
21–24 8 4,800
25–28 9 6,400

Alignment: Always neutral evil.
Type: The creature’s type changes to undead. It retains 
any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as 
good) and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain 
the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature’s 
statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
Armor Class: Natural armor is based on the zombie’s size:
zombie Size natural Armor Bonus
Tiny or smaller +0
Small +1
Medium +2
Large +3
Huge +4
Gargantuan +7
Colossal +11
Hit Dice: Drop HD gained from class levels (minimum 
of 1) and change racial HD to d8s. Zombies gain a number 
of additional HD as noted on the following table.
zombie Size Bonus hit Dice
Tiny or smaller —
Small or Medium +1 HD
Large +2 HD
Huge +4 HD
Gargantuan +6 HD
Colossal +10 HD
Zombies use their Charisma modifiers to determine 
bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).
Saves: Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, 
and Will +1/2 HD + 2.
Defensive Abilities: Zombies lose their defensive 
abilities and gain all of the qualities and immunities 
granted by the undead type. Zombies gain DR 5/slashing.
Speed: Winged zombies can still fly, but maneuverability 
drops to clumsy. If the base creature f lew magically, so 
can the zombie. Retain all other movement types.

Attacks: A zombie retains all the natural weapons, 
manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies 
of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals 
damage based on the zombie’s size, but as if it were 
one size category larger than its actual size (see pages 
301–302).
Special Attacks: A zombie retains none of the base 
creature’s special attacks.
Abilities: Str +2, Dex –2. A zombie has no Con or Int 
score, and its Wis and Cha become 10.
BAB: A zombie’s base attack is equal to 3/4 its Hit Dice.
Skills: A zombie has no skill ranks.
Feats: A zombie loses all Feats possessed by the base 
creature, and does not gain Feats as its Hit Dice increase, 
but it does gain Toughness as a bonus feat.
Special Qualities: A zombie loses most special qualities 
of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special 
qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A 
zombie gains the following special quality.
Staggered (Ex): Zombies have poor ref lexes and can only 
perform a single move action or standard action each 
round. A zombie can move up to its speed and 
attack in the same round as a charge action.
variant	ZoMbies
The typical zombie is a slow-moving 
abomination that is tough to destroy. Yet 
this tough zombie is not the only type of zombie to 
plague crypts or stalk graveyards. Each of the following 
two variant zombies modifies the base zombie in a few 
simple ways.
Fast Zombie
Unlike the standard, plodding zombie, a fast zombie 
moves with a supernatural quickness.
Speed: Increase the base creature’s land speed by 10 feet.
Defensive Abilities: A fast zombie does not gain DR 5/
slashing.
Special Attacks: A fast zombie gains the following 
special attack.
Quick Strikes (Ex): Whenever a fast zombie takes a full-
attack action, it can make one additional slam attack at 
its highest base attack bonus.
Abilities: As a standard zombie, except its Dexterity 
is increased by 2 instead of reduced by 2.
Special Qualities: A fast zombie does not gain the 
staggered special quality.
Plague Zombie
These zombies carry a terrible disease that 
perpetuates their undead lineage—those infected 
by a plague zombie’s contagion rise as zombies 
themselves when they perish.

Defensive Abilities: A plague zombie does not gain DR 
5/slashing.
Special Attacks: A plague zombie gains the following 
special attacks.
Death Burst (Ex): When a plague zombie dies, it explodes in 
a burst of decay. All creatures adjacent to the plague zombie 
are exposed to its plague as if struck by a slam attack and 
must make a Fortitude save or contract zombie rot.
Disease (Su): The slam attack—as well as any other natural 
attacks—of a plague zombie carries the zombie rot disease. 
Zombie rot: slam; save Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 the zombie’s 
Hit Dice + the zombie’s Cha modifier; onset 1d4 days; 
frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be 
healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive 
saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a plague 
zombie in 2d6 hours.

appendix	1:	Monster	Creation
Creating a monster is part science and part art. While 
most monsters follow a general pattern of their overall 
power and abilities as related to their Challenge Rating 
(CR), there are many exceptions. Some monsters, for 
example, have significantly more hit points or a higher 
AC than the average for their CR, but make up for this 
advantage by being weak in other areas. Other monsters 
have significantly higher average damage, but have a 
lower attack bonus.
buildinG	the	Monster
The following guidelines are provided to assist in monster 
creation and to help balance a creation for its CR.
Step 1: Concept
The first step in creating a new monster is to define its 
concept and role in the game. Generally, this involves 
picking the monster’s CR, type, physical appearance, and 
manner of fighting. Once you have these basic pieces 
of information, you should find a number of similar 
monsters of the same type and roughly the same CR for 
comparison purposes.
Step 2: Target Statistics
Once you have a creature’s type and CR determined, use 
Table 1–1 to determine its approximate statistics by CR. 
These values are a rough guideline only. You will notice 
that many of the existing monsters in this book do not 
follow these guidelines exactly. Most monsters excel 
in one of these areas, usually in the amount of damage 
dealt, but lag in one or two other areas to help balance 
them out. When referring to Table 1–1, keep the following 
points in mind.
CR: This is the approximate CR of the monster. This 
number might change as design progresses.
Hit Points: This is the approximate hit point total 
for the monster. Note that creatures with particularly 
high Armor Classes or saving throws, or a number of 
resistances, might have a lower number. Outsiders and 
constructs typically have lower hit point totals.
Armor Class: This is the average Armor Class for a 
creature of this CR. When it comes time to design the 
creature’s protections, keep this number in mind. 
Creatures with hit points above the average often have 
lower Armor Class values to compensate.
High Attack: This is the average total attack bonus for 
a creature of this CR. This value is for creatures that are 
primarily melee or ranged combatants. Creatures with 
a higher than normal average damage typically have a 
lower attack value to compensate.
Low Attack: This is the average total attack bonus for a 
creature of this CR that does not rely upon melee or ranged 

attacks to deal damage. This includes most creatures that 
rely on spells and spell-like abilities in combat.
Average Damage: This is the average amount of 
damage dealt by a creature of this CR if all of its attacks 
are successful. To determine a creature’s average damage, 
add the average value for all of the damage dice rolled 
(as determined by Table 1–5) to the damage modifier for 
each attack.
A creature that relies on melee or ranged weapons in 
combat should have average damage within the range of 
high and low damage.
A creature with higher than normal attack bonuses will 
often deal lower damage, while a creature with lower than 
normal attack bonuses will often deal higher damage.
Primary Ability DC: This is the average difficulty 
class (DC) for any spells, spell-like abilities, and special 
abilities (such as breath weapons) possessed by a creature 
of this CR that relies on such attacks in combat. If an 
ability is particularly powerful, it might have a lower DC 
to compensate.
Secondary Ability DC: This is the average DC for spells 
and special abilities for a creature that does not rely on 
such attacks in combat. Generally, a DC should not be 
lower than this number.
Good Save: This is the average saving throw bonus 
for a creature of this CR if the saving throw is one of the 
creature’s good saving throws.
Poor Save: This is the average saving throw bonus for 
a creature of this CR if the saving throw is one of the 
creature’s poor saving throws.
Step 3: Hit Dice
The next step in creating a monster is to determine 
the approximate number of Hit Dice it has. Hit Dice 
determine a wide variety of other statistics, including 
the creature’s feats, skills, hit points, attack bonuses, and 
special ability DCs. 
A creature’s total number of Hit Dice depends on a 
number of factors, but the two most important are its CR 
and its type. Table 1–2 lists the average number of Hit Dice 
for each creature type, depending on its CR. While many 
of the monsters in this book are close to these values, some 
are not. This is because they have higher or lower average 
hit points to balance out their Armor Class or resistances. 
Step 4: Size
Now that you have the creature’s average statistics, it’s time 
to pick its size. Most creatures range in size from Small 
to Huge, but other sizes are not uncommon. A creature’s 
size sets a baseline for its physical ability scores and its 
natural weapon damage (as noted in the Natural Attacks 
description in the Universal Monster Rules—see Appendix 
3, pages 297–306). You should pick a size that fits well with

the creature’s intended role in the game and Challenge 
Rating. If you decide to give a creature an unusual size for 
its CR or HD, you should justify the unusual choice in the 
monster’s description to account for the discrepancy—in 
most cases, such unusually sized monsters should be highly 
magical in nature. See Table 1–3 for more information on 
creature sizes and expected scores.
Minimum/Maximum CR: These values list the 
minimum and the maximum challenge ratings a creature 
of the indicated size should fall between.

Base Str, Base Dex, Base Con: These list the average 
scores for a creature of this size. Your specific monster’s 
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution might vary greatly 
from these numbers, but if they do, you should pay close 
attention to how these variances affect its other statistics. 
Step 5: Abilities
Once you have determined a creature’s size, type, and 
Hit Dice, it’s time to move on to its ability scores. The 
bonuses granted from these ability scores should increase 291

291

a creature’s hit points, attack bonuses, and saving throws 
to the approximate values presented on Table 1–1.
A creature’s physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, 
and Constitution) should be relatively close to the base 
values presented on Table 1–3, depending on its size. 
Creatures with a few Hit Dice but a high average hit point 
total should have a higher than normal Constitution.
A creature’s mental ability scores (Intelligence, 
Wisdom, and Charisma) are largely defined by the 
creature’s concept. The base for all of these abilities is 
10. Creatures that rely on spells and spell-like abilities in 
combat should have one mental ability score that stands 
out (usually Charisma). Creatures incapable of speech 
have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. Unintelligent 
undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and vermin rarely have 
an Intelligence score.
Step 6: Skills and Feats
Using Table 1–4, determine how many skill ranks your 
creature has based on its type and Hit Dice. Assign these 
ranks as determined by the creature’s concept. Any skill 
that you put points into is considered a class skill for the 
creature. Any skill without assigned skill points is not a 
class skill for the creature, even if advanced versions of 
the creature have ranks in those skills. Creatures with a 
low Intelligence typically only have ranks in Dexterity- 
and Strength-based skills.
After you have assigned skills, it’s time to assign the 
creature’s feats. Each creature with an Intelligence score 
receives a number of Feats equal to 1 + 1 per every 2 Hit 
Dice after the first (so, 1 at 1 HD, 2 at 3 HD, etc.). A creature 
must qualify to take a feat as normal. See Table 1–6 for a 
quick feat calculation chart.
Step 7: Other Statistics
Using Tables 1–1, 1–4, and 1–6, you can now determine 
many of the creature’s other statistics.
When building a creature’s Armor Class, start by adding 
armor, shield, and natural armor bonuses to its Dexterity 
modifier. If a creature does not wear armor, give it a tougher 

hide to get it near its average AC. Remember that creatures 
with higher hit point totals might have a lower Armor Class, 
whereas creatures with fewer hit points might have a higher 
Armor Class. If a creature’s Armor Class deviates from the 
average by more than 5 points, it might not be the right CR.
When determining a creature’s attack bonuses, refer to 
the guidelines from Table 1–1 based on the creature’s CR. 
If the bonus is too low, consider increasing the creature’s 
Strength or Dexterity, or increasing the amount of damage it 
deals to above the average. If the bonus is too high, consider 
decreasing the creature’s Strength or Dexterity, or decrease 
the amount of damage it deals. If this value is significantly 
different, and the creature is intended to rely on melee or 
ranged attacks, consider adjusting the creature’s CR.
Use Table 1–5 to determine the number of damage dice, 
combined with damage bonuses, that the creature needs 
to reach the average damage for its CR. The creature might 
need additional or more damaging attacks to approach 
the average. Remember that creatures that primarily deal 
damage with other abilities, such as spells, do not need to 
meet the average damage for their attacks. You can also 
use Table 1–5 to determine a creature’s average hit points. 
Remember that PC class levels provide the maximum 
number of hit points at 1st level.
Repeat this process for a creature’s saving throws. If the 
saving throws are too high, consider altering the ability 
scores on which they are based. 
When determining a creature’s speed, first decide if it 
has any alternative modes of movement, such as burrow, 
climb, f ly, or swim. Most Medium creatures have a base 
speed of 30 feet. Quadrupeds and Large creatures increase 
this by 10 feet each. Smaller creatures decrease this base 
speed by 10 feet. If a creature is particularly fast or slow, 
modify the base speed by 10 feet. Burrow and climb speeds 
are usually half a creature’s base speed, while f lying speeds 
are roughly double. Remember to give a creature the 
appropriate skills for any unusual movement methods.
Step 8: Special Abilities and Qualities
Monsters are different from characters in that they can have 
all sorts of different special abilities and qualities. Each of 
these is tied closely to the creature’s concept, allowing it 
to fill a specific role in the game. For examples, look at 
monsters in this book. Monsters should use abilities from 
the Universal Monster Rules whenever possible, instead of 
creating new yet similar abilities—when you do create new 
abilities, use the Universal Monster Rules as a template for 
how to present and create the new abilities.
Most special abilities that cause damage, such as breath 
weapons, give a save (Fortitude, Ref lex, or Will depending 
on the ability). The DC for almost all special abilities is 
equal to 10 + 1/2 the creature’s Hit Dice + a relevant ability 
modifier (usually Constitution or Charisma depending

on the ability). Special abilities that add to melee and 
ranged attacks generally do not allow a save, as they rely 
on the attacks hitting to be useful. 
Special senses and resistances to certain energy types are 
common in creatures of CR 5 and lower. Damage reduction, 
energy immunities, and regeneration are more common 
in creatures above CR 5. Spell resistance and immunities 
become more common above CR 10. As a general rule a 
creature’s spell resitance should equal its CR + 11.
Step 9: Treasure
A creature should have an amount of treasure appropriate 
to its CR. See Table 1–7 for a list of treasure totals based on 
CR. For some creatures, their treasure consists of the loot 
from their recent meals strewn across their lairs, while for 
others it consists of a greed-fueled hoard or even gear it 
uses in combat. Make sure to account for any weapons or 
armor that the creature is using, as determined by step 7.
Step 10: Details
Now that you have all of the creature’s statistics sorted out, 
it’s time to fill in all the details—such as name, alignment, 
space, reach, environment, and ecology—as you see fit.

appendix	2:	Monster	advanCeMent
The following rules allow you to adjust monsters, 
increasing (or even decreasing) their statistics and abilities 
while still creating a balanced and fun encounter.
teMplates
A template is a set of rules that you apply to a monster to 
transform it into a different monster. All templates give 
precise directions on how to change a monster’s statistics 
to transform it into the new monster.
Acquired Templates: Some templates, like the lich, are 
the results of a creature’s choice and desire to transform. 
Others, like the ghost template, are the result of an 
external force acting upon a creature (for example, when 
a tormented person dies and becomes a ghost). Yet in 
both cases, the template changed a creature well after 
its birth or creation—these types are called “acquired 
templates,” and can be added to a creature at any time 
during its existance.
Inherited Templates: Some templates, such as the half-
dragon and half-fiend templates, are part of a creature 
from the beginning of its existence. Creatures are born 
or created with these templates already in place, and have 
never known life without them. These types of templates 
are called “inherited templates.”
siMple	teMplates
Simple templates can be applied during the game with 
minimal effort. This makes it easy, for example, to deal 
with celestial and fiendish creatures conjured in the heat 
of battle by summon monster spells.
All simple templates have two categories of changes. 
The “quick rules” present a fast way to modify die rolls 
made in play to simulate the template’s effects without 
actually rebuilding the stat block—this method works 
great for summoned creatures. The “rebuild rules” list 
the exact changes you make to the base stat block if you 
have the time to completely rebuild it—this method 
works best when you have time during game preparation 
to build full stat blocks. The two methods result in 
creatures of similar, if not identical, abilities.
Advanced Creature (CR +1)
Creatures with the advanced template are fiercer and 
more powerful than their ordinary cousins. 
Quick Rules: +2 on all rolls (including damage rolls) 
and special ability DCs; +4 to AC and CMD; +2 hp/HD.
Rebuild Rules: AC increase natural armor by +2; Ability 
Scores +4 to all ability scores.
Celestial Creature (CR +0 or +1)
Celestial creatures dwell in the higher planes, but can 
be summoned using spells such as summon monster 

and planar ally. A celestial creature’s CR increases by +1 
only if the base creature has 5 or more HD. A celestial 
creature’s quick and rebuild rules are the same.
Rebuild Rules: Senses gains darkvision 60 ft.; Defensive 
Abilities gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the 
table; SR gains SR equal to new CR +5; Special Attacks smite 
evil 1/day as a swift action (adds Cha bonus to attack rolls 
and damage bonus equal to HD against evil foes; smite 
persists until target is dead or the celestial creature rests).

addinG	raCial	hit	diCe
Adding racial Hit Dice to a monster is a similar process to 
building a monster from scratch. As additional Hit Dice are 
added, other abilities increase in power as well. Additional 
Hit Dice usually results in better attack bonuses, saves, hit 
points, and skills, as well as more feats. It can also include 
additional spellcasting capability and other powers.
Step 1: Plan the Monster
When advancing a monster by adding racial HD, you 
should start by deciding what you want the monster to 

become. In most cases, this means merely a tougher, 
stronger version of an existing monster. Note the desired 
CR of the new monster. This is also the point at which 
you should decide whether the creature is going to 
increase in size. As a general rule, creatures whose Hit 
Dice increase by 50% or more should also increase in size, 
but GMs should feel free to ignore this rule if warranted 
by the individual creature or situation.
Step 2: Add Hit Dice
Next, determine how many Hit Points the base monster 
receives per Hit Die (see Table 1–5 for average results 
based on the die type). Using Table 2–1, add up all of the 
values in the Hit Point Change column for each increase 
using the Higher CR column. For example, if the base 
monster was CR 3 and the new monster is set to be CR 
5, the total would be 25 hit points. Next, add additional 
Hit Dice to the monster to increase its hit points by the 
desired amount. Note that if the creature increases in 
size, its Constitution may also increase, as noted on Table 
2–2, granting it additional hit points that might offset 
the need for additional Hit Dice (this also applies to any 
other Constitution increases).
These values are not absolute. Some monsters have fewer 
hit points than normal for a creature of their CR and rely on 
a higher AC or other defenses. Some creatures are primarily

spellcasters and typically have fewer Hit Dice. When 
advancing your monster in this way, be sure to take these 
factors into account and adjust your monster accordingly.
Step 3: Ability Scores
Once you have determined the number of additional Hit Dice 
possessed by the creature, use this number to modify its other 
statistics. Start with ability scores. For every 4 additional Hit 
Dice gained by the monster, add 1 to one of its ability scores. 
In addition, make any modifications to its ability scores 
based on an increase in size, as noted on Table 2–2. 
Step 4: Skills and Feats
When adding skills, check to see if the creature’s Int 
modifier changed. If it is unchanged, simply multiply the 

total number of ranks per Hit Dice gained by a monster 
of its type times the total number of added Hit Dice and 
add that number of ranks to its existing skills. If its 
Intelligence modifier has increased, perform the same 
calculation as if it had not increased and then multiply 
the change in its Intelligence modifier times its new total 
number of Hit Dice and add that number of additional 
ranks as well (adding new skills as needed to spend all 
of the ranks). If the creature changed size, make sure to 
adjust its Fly skill and Stealth skill bonuses (if any) as 
noted on Table 2–3.
Next, give the creature additional feats. Creatures gain 
one feat at 1 Hit Die and one additional feat for every 2 Hit 
Dice above 1. Most additional Feats should be focused on 
increasing the creature’s combat abilities, but metamagic 
Feats and skill feats are also possible choices depending 
on the creature’s role.
Step 5: Statistics
Next, adjust the creature’s derived statistics, such as its 
initiative, AC, saving throws, melee and ranged attack 
bonuses, BAB, CMB, and CMD. Adjust any special attacks 
or qualities that are based on the creature’s size, Hit Dice, 
or ability scores. If the creature changed in size, be sure 
to adjust its AC, attack, CMB, and CMD accordingly (as 
noted on Table 2–3). Table 2–1 also tracks the average 
change to the creature’s AC, attack rolls, and damage 
rolls. Add up these values for each step of change between 
the creature’s original and new CR. If the creature 
changed size, make sure to make changes to its natural 
armor bonus, as noted on Table 2–2. If the creature does 
not meet these averages, you should consider adjusting 
its ability scores or Hit Dice to get it closer to the target.
Step 6: Comparison
Finally, compare the new monster’s statistics to those 
presented on Table 1–1 for a creature of its adjusted CR. 
Note that if the original creature deviated from these 
values, the new one should do so in a similar fashion. For 
example, if the original creature had higher than normal 
hit points but a lower than normal CR, the creature 
should maintain that balance at a higher CR (even though 
its hit points and AC both increased).
addinG	Class	levels
Of all the methods of advancing a monster, adding 
class levels requires the most adjudication and careful 
comparison. Some classes truly add to the power and 
abilities of some monster types, while others do not. For 
example, adding levels of barbarian to a hill giant can be 
a great addition, whereas adding levels of sorcerer is less 
useful. When adding class levels to a creature, take the 
following three steps.

Table 2–2: Size Changes
Old Size* new Size Str Dex Con natural Armor
Fine Diminutive Same –2 Same Same
Diminutive Tiny +2 –2 Same Same
Tiny Small +4 –2 Same Same
Small Medium +4 –2 +2 Same
Medium Large +8 –2 +4 +2
Large Huge +8 –2 +4 +3
Huge Gargantuan +8 Same +4 +4
Gargantuan Colossal +8 Same +4 +5
* Repeat the adjustment if the creature moves up more than 
one size.
Table 2–3: Size Bonuses and Penalties
Size AC/Attack CMB/CMD fly Skill Stealth Skill
Fine +8 –8 +8 +16
Diminutive +4 –4 +6 +12
Tiny +2 –2 +4 +8
Small +1 –1 +2 +4
Medium +0 +0 +0 +0
Large –1 +1 –2 –4
Huge –2 +2 –4 –8
Gargantuan –4 +4 –6 –12
Colossal –8 +8 –8 –16

Reducing Hit Dice
The rules for increasing a creature’s Hit Dice can be used to 
reduce them as well, creating a weak or infant version of the 
creature. While the process is the same as for increasing a 
creature’s Hit Dice, each individual step is reversed, with the 
creature taking a reduction in Hit Dice, hit points, and other 
statistics based on these values. When using Table 2–1, use 
the Lower CR column when adding up the average reductions 
to its statistics. As a general rule, if a creature loses 50% of its 
original Hit Dice, it should probably reduce in size as well.

296

296

Step 1: Determine Creature’s Role
When adding class levels to a creature, the first step is 
to determine what role the base creature fulfills. There 
are three basic roles into which a creature might fall. A 
creature can fall into more than one role if its abilities 
are diverse.
Combat: This creature is designed to be good at 
melee or ranged combat with a weapon or its natural 
weapons. In either case, these monsters have a 
number of Feats and abilities to enhance their combat 
prowess (or are good simply by nature of their Hit Dice 
and ability scores). If a creature does not possess many 
spells, special abilities, or skills, it is a combat monster.
Most animals, constructs, dragons, humanoids, 
magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, plants, and 
vermin fall into this role, as do some creatures of all the 
other types.
Spell: Spell creatures possess a large number of spells 
that allow them to attack or harass their enemies. These 
creatures usually have lower hit points and relatively 
weak attacks as compared to the averages for creatures 
of their CR. Note that creatures that only possess spell-
like abilities do not fall into this role, and are usually 
considered combat or special.
Most dragons and outsiders fall into this role, but any 
creature that has a list of spells prepared or spells known 
likely falls under this heading as well.
Skill: Creatures of this type rely on skills (usually 
Stealth) to ambush or take down their prey. This also 
includes creatures who take advantage of the environment 
or spells, such as fog or invisibility.
Some aberrations, fey, magical beasts, monstrous 
humanoids, and outsiders fall into this role.
Special: Creatures that do not fall into any of the other 
categories usually rely on special abilities and powers to 
attack their foes. They might be tough or dangerous in 
physical combat, but the threat is greatly increased by 
their special abilities.
A list of monster roles for determining key classes 
appears in Appendix 13.
Step 2: Add Class Levels
Once you have determined the creature’s role, it’s time to 
add class levels. The first step of this process is to modify 
the creature’s ability scores. Creatures with class levels 
receive +4, +4, +2, +2, +0, and –2 adjustments to their 
ability scores, assigned in a manner that enhances their 
class abilities. Creatures with NPC class levels do not 
receive adjustments to their ability scores.
Next, add the class levels to the monster, making all 
of the necessary additions to its HD, hit points, BAB, 
CMB, CMD, feats, skills, spells, and class features. If the 
creature possesses class features (such as spellcasting 

or sneak attack) for the class that is being added, these 
abilities stack. This functions just like adding class 
levels to a character without racial Hit Dice.
A monster with class levels always possesses treasure 
equal to an NPC of a level equal to the monster’s final CR 
(as calculated in Step 3, below). To determine the value of 
this gear, use the value listed for a heroic NPC of that CR, 
as listed on page 454 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. 
Once a total GP value is determined, follow the rules for 
outfitting an NPC as outlined in that chapter. Gear should 
help a monster with class levels remain challenging and 
retain statistics close to those presented on Table 1-1: 
Monster Statistics by CR.
Step 3: Determine CR
Determining the final CR for a creature with class levels 
requires careful consideration. While adding a class level 
to a monster that stacks with its existing abilities and 
role generally adds 1 to its CR for each level taken, adding 
classes that do not stack is more complicated.
Table 2–4 gives general guidelines regarding which 
core classes add directly to a monster’s abilities based 
on its role. Classes that are marked “key” generally add 
1 to a creature’s CR for each level added. Classes marked 
with a “—” increase a creature’s CR by 1 for every 2 class 
levels added until the number of levels added are equal 
to (or exceed) the creature’s original CR, at which point 
they are treated as “key” levels (adding 1 to the creature’s 
CR for each level added). Creatures that fall into multiple 
roles treat a class as key if either of its roles treat the 
class as key. Note that levels in NPC classes are never 
considered key.

Ability Damage and Drain (Ex or Su) Some attacks or 
special abilities cause ability damage or drain, reducing 
the designated ability score by the listed amount. While 
ability damage can be healed naturally, ability drain is 
permanent and can only be restored through magic.
Format: 1d4 Str drain; Location: Special Attacks and 
individual attacks.
Amphibious (Ex) Creatures with this special quality 
have the aquatic subtype, but they can survive indefinitely 
on land.
Format: amphibious; Location: SQ.
Bleed (Ex) A creature with this ability causes wounds that 
continue to bleed, inflicting additional damage each round 
at the start of the affected creature’s turn. This bleeding can 
be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or through 
the application of any magical healing. The amount of 
damage each round is determined in the creature’s entry.
Format: bleed (2d6); Location: Special Attacks and 
individual attacks.
Blindsense (Ex) Using nonvisual senses, such as acute 
smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense notices things 
it cannot see. The creature usually does not need to make 
Perception checks to pinpoint the location of a creature 
within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has 
line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature 
cannot see still has total concealment against the creature 
with blindsense, and the creature still has the normal 
miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. 
Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with 
blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied 
its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from 
creatures it cannot see.
Format: blindsense 60 ft.; Location: Senses.
Blindsight (Ex) This ability is similar to blindsense, 
but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such 
as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or 
echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and 
fights as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, 
and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the 
creature must have line of effect to a creature or object 
to discern that creature or object. The ability’s range is 
specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature 
usually does not need to make Perception checks to 
notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. 
Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and 
the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of 
blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If 
so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature 
must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the 
benefits of blindsight only during its turn.
Format: blindsight 60 ft.; Location: Senses.
Breath Weapon (Su) Some creatures can exhale a cone, 
line, or cloud of energy or other magical effects. A breath 

weapon attack usually deals damage and is often based 
on some type of energy. Breath weapons allow a Ref lex 
save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creature’s 
racial HD + breathing creature’s Con modifier; the exact 
DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A creature 
is immune to its own breath weapon unless otherwise 
noted. Some breath weapons allow a Fortitude save or a 
Will save instead of a Ref lex save. Each breath weapon 
also includes notes on how often it can be used, even if 
this number is limited in times per day.
Format: breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 8d6 fire damage, Reflex 
DC 20 for half, usable every 1d4 rounds); Location: Special 
Attacks; if the breath is more complicated than damage, it 
also appears under Special Abilities with its own entry.
Burn (Ex) A creature with the burn special attack deals 
fire damage in addition to damage dealt on a successful 
hit in melee. Those affected by the burn ability must also 
succeed on a Ref lex save or catch fire, taking the listed 
damage for an additional 1d4 rounds at the start of its 
turn (DC 10 + 1/2 burning creature’s racial HD + burning 
creature’s Con modifier). A burning creature can attempt 
a new save as a full-round action. Dropping and rolling on 
the ground grants a +4 bonus on this save. Creatures that 
hit a burning creature with natural weapons or unarmed 
attacks take fire damage as though hit by the burning 
creature and must make a Ref lex save to avoid catching 
on fire (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, page 444).
Format: burn (2d6, DC 15); Location: Special Attacks and 
individual attacks.
Change Shape (Su) A creature with this special quality 
has the ability to assume the appearance of a specific 
creature or type of creature (usually a humanoid), but 
retains most of its own physical qualities. A creature 
cannot change shape to a form more than one size category 
smaller or larger than its original form. This ability 
functions as a polymorph spell, the type of which is listed in 
the creature’s description, but the creature does not adjust 
its ability scores (although it gains any other abilities of the 
creature it mimics). Some creatures, such as lycanthropes, 
can transform into unique forms with special modifiers 
and abilities. These creatures do adjust their ability scores, 
as noted in their description. 
Format: change shape (wolf, beast form I); Location: SQ, 
and in special abilities for creatures with a unique listing.
Channel Resistance (Ex) A creature with this special 
quality (usually an undead) is less easily affected by clerics 
or paladins. A creature with channel resistance adds the 
bonus listed for that creature to saves made to resist the 
effects of channel energy, including effects that rely on the 
use of channel energy (such as the Command Undead feat).
Format: channel resistance +4; Location: Defensive Abilities.
Constrict (Ex) A creature with this special attack can 
crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, when 

298

298

it makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any 
other effects caused by a successful check, including 
additional damage). The amount of damage is given in 
the creature’s entry and is typically equal to the amount 
of damage caused by the creature’s melee attack.
Format: constrict (1d8+6); Location: Special Attacks.
Construct Traits (Ex) Constructs are immune to 
death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects (charms, 
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), 
necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and 
any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect 
also works on objects, or is harmless). Constructs are 
not subject to nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability 
drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. Constructs 
are not at risk of death from massive damage.
Format: construct traits; Location: Immune.
Curse (Su) A creature with this ability bestows a curse 
upon its enemies. The effects of the curse, including its 
save, frequency, and cure, are included in the creature’s 
description. If a curse allows a saving throw, it is usually 
a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 cursing creature’s racial HD + 
creature’s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the 
creature’s descriptive text). Curses can be removed 
through remove curse and similar effects.
Format: Curse Name (Su) Slam—contact; save Will DC 
14, frequency 1 day, effect 1d4 Str drain; Location: Special 
Attacks and individual attacks.
Damage Reduction (Ex or Su) A creature with this 
special quality ignores damage from most weapons and 
natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon 
bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent 
knows the attack was ineffective). The creature takes 
normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical 
ones), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural 
abilities. A certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage 
the creature normally, as noted below.
The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored 
(usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates 
the ability. 
Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, 
or slashing damage. Others are vulnerable to certain 
materials, such as adamantine, alchemical silver, or cold-
forged iron. Attacks from weapons that are not of the 
correct type or made of the correct material have their 
damage reduced, although a high enhancement bonus 
can overcome some forms of damage reduction.
Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any 
weapon with at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus 
on attack and damage rolls overcomes the damage 
reduction of these monsters. Such creatures’ natural 
weapons (but not their attacks with weapons) are treated 
as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage 
reduction.

A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to 
epic weapons—that is, magic weapons with at least a +6 
enhancement bonus. Such creatures’ natural weapons 
are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of 
overcoming damage reduction.
Some monsters are vulnerable to good-, evil-, 
chaotically, or lawfully aligned weapons. When a cleric 
casts align weapon, affected weapons might gain one or 
more of these properties, and certain magic weapons have 
these properties as well. A creature with an alignment 
subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome this 
type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and 
weapons it wields as if the weapons or natural weapons 
had an alignment (or alignments) that matched the 
subtype(s) of the creature. 
When a damage reduction entry has a dash (—) after 
the slash, no weapon negates the damage reduction.
A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of 
weapon. A weapon that inf licts damage of either type 
overcomes this damage reduction.
A few other creatures require combinations of different 
types of attacks to overcome their damage reduction, and 
a weapon must be both types to overcome this type of 
damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type is still 
subject to damage reduction.
Format: DR 5/silver; Location: Defensive Abilities.
Disease (Ex or Su) A creature with this ability causes 
disease in those it contacts. The effects of the disease, 
including its save, frequency, and cure, are included in 
the creature’s description. The saving throw to negate 
the disease is usually a Fort save (DC 10 + 1/2 infecting 
creature’s racial HD + the creature’s Con modifier; the 
exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). Disease 
can be removed through cure disease and similar effects.
Format: Disease Name (Ex) Bite—injury; save Fort DC 15, 
onset 1d3 days, frequency 1 day, effect 1 Con damage, cure 2 
consecutive saves; Location: Special Attacks and individual 
attacks.
Distraction (Ex) A creature with this ability can 
nauseate the creatures that it damages. Any living 
creature that takes damage from a creature with the 
distraction ability is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude 
save (DC 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD + creature’s Con modifier) 
negates the effect.
Format: distraction (DC 14); Location: Special Attacks.
Energy Drain (Su) This attack saps a living opponent’s 
vital energy and happens automatically when a melee or 
ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain bestows 
one or more negative levels (the creature’s description 
specifies how many). If an attack that includes an energy 
drain scores a critical hit, it bestows twice the listed 
number of negative levels. Unless otherwise specified 
in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains 299

299

AAppendices

ppendices

5 temporary hit points for each negative level it bestows 
on an opponent. These temporary hit points last for a 
maximum of 1 hour. Negative levels remain until 24 
hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell, 
such as restoration. If a negative level is not removed 
before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature must 
attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s 
racial HD + draining creature’s Cha modifier; the exact 
DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). On a 
success, the negative level goes away with no harm to 
the creature. On a failure, the negative level becomes 
permanent. A separate saving throw is required for each 
negative level.
Format: energy drain (2 levels, DC 18); Location: Special 
Attacks and individual attacks.
Fast Healing (Ex) A creature with the fast healing 
special quality regains hit points at an exceptional rate, 
usually 1 or more hit points per round, as given in the 
creature’s entry. Except where noted here, fast healing is 
just like natural healing. Fast healing does not restore 
hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor 
does it allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless 
otherwise stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be 
reattached. Fast healing continues to function (even at 
negative hit points) until a creature dies, at which point 
the effects of fast healing end immediately.
Format: fast healing 5; Location: hp.
Fear (Su or Sp) Fear attacks can have various effects.
Fear Aura (Su) The use of this ability is a free action. The 
aura can freeze an opponent (as in the case of a mummy’s 
despair) or function like the fear spell. Other effects are 
possible. A fear aura is an area effect. The descriptive text 
gives the size and kind of the area.
Fear Cone (Sp) and Ray (Su) These effects usually work 
like the fear spell. 
If a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC 
10 + 1/2 fearsome creature’s racial HD + creature’s Cha 
modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive 
text). All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear effects.
Format: fear aura (30 ft., DC 17); Location: Aura.
Format: fear cone (50 ft., DC 19); Location: Special Attacks.
Ferocity (Ex) A creature with ferocity remains conscious 
and can continue fighting even if its hit point total is 
below 0. The creature is still staggered and looses 1 hit 
point each round. A creature with ferocity still dies when 
its hit point total reaches a negative amount equal to its 
Constitution score.
Format: ferocity; Location: Defensive Abilities.
Flight (Ex or Su) A creature with this ability can 
cease or resume f light as a free action. If the ability is 
supernatural, it becomes ineffective in an antimagic 
field, and the creature loses its ability to f ly for as long as 
the antimagic effect persists.

Format: f ly 30 ft. (average); Location: Speed.
Frightful Presence (Ex) This special quality makes a 
creature’s very presence unsettling to foes. Activating this 
ability is a free action that is usually part of an attack or 
charge. Opponents within range who witness the action 
may become frightened or shaken. The range is usually 30 
feet, and the duration is usually 5d6 rounds. This ability 
affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than 
the creature has. An affected opponent can resist the 
effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful 
creature’s racial HD + frightful creature’s Cha modifier; 
the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). An 
opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune 
to that same creature’s frightful presence for 24 hours. 
Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Format: frightful presence (60 ft., DC 21); Location: Aura.
Gaze (Su) A gaze special attack takes effect when foes 
look at the attacking creature’s eyes. The attack can 
have any sort of effect: petrification, death, and charm 
are common. The typical range is 30 feet, but check the 
creature’s entry for details. The type of saving throw for a 
gaze attack varies, but it is usually a Will or Fortitude save 
(DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial HD + gazing creature’s 
Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s text). A 
successful saving throw negates the effect. A monster’s gaze 
attack is described in abbreviated form in its description. 
Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt 
a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her 
turn in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a 
creature with a gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. 
Opponents can avoid the need to make the saving throw by 
not looking at the creature, in one of two ways. 
Averting Eyes: The opponent avoids looking at the 
creature’s face, instead looking at its body, watching 
its shadow, tracking it in a ref lective surface, etc. Each 
round, the opponent has a 50% chance to avoid having to 
make a saving throw against the gaze attack. The creature 
with the gaze attack, however, gains concealment against 
that opponent.
Wearing a Blindfold: The foe cannot see the creature at 
all (also possible to achieve by turning one’s back on the 
creature or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze 
attack gains total concealment against the opponent. 
A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an 
attack action by choosing a target within range. That 
opponent must attempt a saving throw but can try to 
avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an 
opponent to save against a creature’s gaze twice during 
the same round, once before the opponent’s action and 
once during the creature’s turn. 
Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature 
is immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless 
otherwise noted. Allies of a creature with a gaze attack 

300

300

might be affected. All the creature’s allies are considered 
to be averting their eyes from the creature with the 
gaze attack, and have a 50% chance to not need to make 
a saving throw against the gaze attack each round. 
The creature can also veil its eyes, thus negating its 
gaze ability.
Format: gaze; Location: Special Attacks.
Grab (Ex) If a creature with this special attack hits 
with the indicated attack (usually a claw or bite attack), it 
deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a 
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 
Unless otherwise noted, grab works only against 
opponents at least one size category smaller than the 
creature. The creature has the option to conduct the 
grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it 
used in the grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to 
do the latter, it takes a –20 penalty on its CMB check 
to make and maintain the grapple, but does not gain 
the grappled condition itself. A successful hold does not 
deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the 
constrict special attack. If the creature does not constrict, 
each successful grapple check it makes during successive 
rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for 
the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals 
constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the 
creature’s descriptive text).
Creatures with the grab special attack receive a +4 
bonus on combat maneuver checks made to start and 
maintain a grapple.
Format: grab; Location: individual attacks.
Immunity (Ex or Su) A creature with immunities takes 
no damage from listed sources. Immunities can also apply 
to aff lictions, conditions, spells (based on school, level, 
or save type), and other effects. A creature that is immune 
does not suffer from these effects, or any secondary effects 
that are triggered due to an immune effect.
Format: Immune acid, fire, paralysis; Location: 
Defensive Abilities.
Incorporeal (Ex) An incorporeal creature has 
no physical body. It can be harmed only by other 
incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that 
strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, 
or supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical 
attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, 
it takes only half damage from a corporeal source. 
Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can affect 
incorporeal undead. Corporeal spells and effects that do 
not cause damage only have a 50% chance of affecting 
an incorporeal creature. Force spells and effects, such 
as from a magic missile, affect an incorporeal creature 
normally.
An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus 
but has a def lection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus 

(always at least +1, even if the creature’s Charisma score 
does not normally provide a bonus). 
An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid 
objects, but must remain adjacent to the object’s exterior, 
and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space 
is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures 
or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, 
but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) 
from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In 
order to see beyond the object it is in and attack normally, 
the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal 
creature inside an object has total cover, but when it 
attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a 
creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as 
it attacks. An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a 
force effect.
An incorporeal creature’s attacks pass through (ignore) 
natural armor, armor, and shields, although def lection 
bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work 
normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass through 
and operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal 
creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal 
creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can 
they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take 
any physical action that would move or manipulate an 
opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such 
actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not 
set off traps that are triggered by weight.
An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be 
heard with Perception checks if it doesn’t wish to be. It has 
no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to its 
melee attacks, ranged attacks, and CMB. Nonvisual senses, 
such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only 
partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. 
Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction 
and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.
Format: incorporeal; Location: Defensive Abilities.
Light Blindness (Ex) Creatures with light blindness 
are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as 
sunlight or the daylight spell. Such creatures are dazzled 
as long as they remain in areas of bright light.
Format: light blindness; Location: Weaknesses.
Light Sensitivity (Ex) Creatures with light sensitivity 
are dazzled in areas of bright sunlight or within the 
radius of a daylight spell.
Format: Weakness light sensitivity; Location: Weaknesses.
Low-Light Vision (Ex) A creature with low-light vision can 
see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, 
and similar conditions of dim light. It retains the ability to 
distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Format: low-light vision; Location: Senses.
Natural Attacks Most creatures possess one or more 
natural attacks (attacks made without a weapon). These 301

301

AAppendices

ppendices

attacks fall into one of two categories, primary and 
secondary attacks. Primary attacks are made using the 
creature’s full base attack bonus and add the creature’s 
full Strength bonus on damage rolls. Secondary attacks 
are made using the creature’s base attack bonus –5 and 
add only 1/2 the creature’s Strength bonus on damage 
rolls. If a creature has only one natural attack, it is always 
made using the creature’s full base attack bonus and adds 
1-1/2 the creature’s Strength bonus on attack rolls. This 
increase does not apply if the creature has multiple attacks 
but only takes one. If a creature has only one type of attack, 
but has multiple attacks per round, that attack is treated 
as a primary attack, regardless of its type. Table 3–1 lists 
some of the most common types of natural attacks and 
their classifications.
Some creatures treat one or more of their attacks 
differently, such as dragons, which always receive 1-1/2 
times their Strength bonus on damage rolls with their 
bite attack. These exceptions are noted in the creature’s 
description.
Creatures with natural attacks and attacks made with 
weapons can use both as part of a full attack action 
(although often a creature must forgo one natural 
attack for each weapon clutched in that limb, be it a 
claw, tentacle, or slam). Such creatures attack with their 
weapons normally but treat all of their natural attacks 
as secondary attacks during that attack, regardless of the 
attack’s original type.
The Damage Type column refers to the sort of damage 
that the natural attack typically deals: bludgeoning (B), 
slashing (S), or piercing (P). Some attacks deal damage of 
more than one type, depending on the creature. In such 
cases all the damage is considered to be of all listed types 
for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
Some fey, humanoids, monstrous humanoids, and 
outsiders do not possess natural attacks. These creatures 
can make unarmed strikes, but treat them as weapons 
for the purpose of determining attack bonuses, and they 
must use the two-weapon fighting rules when making 

attacks with both hands. See Table 3–1 for typical damage 
values for natural attacks by creature size.
Format: bite +5 (1d6+1), 2 claws +5 (1d4+2), 4 tentacles +0 
(1d4+1); Location: Melee and Ranged.
Paralysis (Ex or Su) This special attack renders the 
victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, 
speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted 
to the spot, frozen and helpless. Paralysis works on the 
body, and a character can usually resist it with a Fortitude 
saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 paralyzing creature’s racial HD 
+ paralyzing creature’s Con modifier; the DC is given in 
the creature’s description). Unlike hold person and similar 
effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a new save each 
round. A winged creature f lying in the air at the time that 
it is paralyzed cannot f lap its wings and falls. A swimmer 
can’t swim and may drown. The duration of the paralysis 
varies and is included in the creature’s description.
Format: paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 18); Location: Special 
Attacks and individual attacks.
Plant Traits (Ex) Plants are immune to all mind-affecting 
effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and 
phantasms), paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun.
Format: plant traits; Location: Immune.
Poison (Ex or Su) A creature with this ability can poison 
those it attacks. The effects of the poison, including its 
save, frequency, and cure, are included in the creature’s 
description. The saving throw to resist a poison is usually 
a Fort save (DC 10 + 1/2 poisoning creature’s racial HD 
+ creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in the 
creature’s descriptive text). Poisons can be removed 
through neutralize poison and similar effects.
Format: Poison Name (Ex) Sting—injury; save Fort 
DC 22, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d4 Con, 
cure 2 consecutive saves; Location: Special Attacks and 
individual attacks.
Pounce (Ex) When a creature with this special attack 
makes a charge, it can make a full attack (including rake 
attacks if the creature also has the rake ability).
Format: pounce; Location: Special Attacks.

Powerful Charge (Ex) When a creature with this special 
attack makes a charge, its attack deals extra damage in 
addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge. 
The attack and amount of damage from the attack is 
given in the creature’s description.
Format: powerful charge (gore, 4d8+24); Location: 
Special Attacks.
Pull (Ex) A creature with this ability can choose to 
make a free combat maneuver check with a successful 
attack. If successful, this check pulls a creature closer. 
The distance pulled is set by this ability. The type of 
attack that causes the pull and the distance pulled are 
included in the creature’s description. This ability only 
works on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the 
pulling creature. Creatures pulled in this way do not 
provoke attacks of opportunity and stop if the pull would 
move them into a solid object or creature.
Format: pull (tentacle, 5 feet); Location: Special Attacks 
and individual attacks.
Push (Ex) A creature with the push ability can choose 
to make a free combat maneuver check with a certain 
successful attack (often a slam attack). If successful, this 
check pushes a creature directly away as with a bull rush, 
but the distance moved is set by this ability. The type of 
attack that causes the push and the distance pushed are 
included in the creature’s description. This ability only 
works on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the 
pushing creature. Creatures pushed in this way do not 
provoke attacks of opportunity and stop if the push would 
move them into a solid object or creature.
Format: push (slam, 10 feet); Location: Special Attacks 
and individual attacks.
Rake (Ex) A creature with this special attack gains 
extra natural attacks under certain conditions, typically 
when it grapples its foe. In addition to the options 
available to all grapplers, a monster with the rake ability 
gains two additional claw attacks that it can use only 
against a grappled foe. The bonus and damage caused by 
these attacks is included in the creature’s description. A 
monster with the rake ability must begin its turn already 
grappling to use its rake—it can’t begin a grapple and 
rake in the same turn.
Format: rake (2 claws +8, 1d4+2); Location: Special 
Attacks.
Regeneration (Ex) A creature with this ability is 
difficult to kill. Creatures with regeneration heal damage 
at a fixed rate, as with fast healing, but they cannot die as 
long as their regeneration is still functioning (although 
creatures with regeneration still fall unconscious when 
their hit points are below 0). Certain attack forms, 
typically fire and acid, cause a creature’s regeneration 
to stop functioning on the round following the attack. 
During this round, the creature does not heal any damage 

and can die normally. The creature’s descriptive text 
describes the types of damage that cause the regeneration 
to cease functioning. 
Attack forms that don’t deal hit point damage are not 
healed by regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore 
hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. 
Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their 
bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts if they 
are brought together within 1 hour of severing. Severed 
parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.
A creature must have a Constitution score to have the 
regeneration ability.
Format: regeneration 5 (fire, acid); Location: hp.
Rend (Ex) If it hits with two or more natural attacks in 
1 round, a creature with the rend special attack can cause 
tremendous damage by latching onto the opponent’s body 
and tearing f lesh. This attack deals an additional amount 
of damage, but no more than once per round. The type 
of attacks that must hit and the additional damage are 
included in the creature’s description. The additional 
damage is usually equal to the damage caused by one of 
the attacks plus 1-1/2 the creature’s Strength bonus.
Format: rend (2 claws, 1d8+9); Location: Special Attacks.
Resistance (Ex) A creature with this special quality 
ignores some damage of the indicated type each time 
it takes damage of that kind (commonly acid, cold, 
electricity, or fire). The entry indicates the amount and 
type of damage ignored.
Format: Resist acid 10; Location: Defensive Abilities.
Rock Catching (Ex) The creature (which must be of 
at least Large size) can catch Small, Medium, or Large 
rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once per round, a 
creature that would normally be hit by a rock can make 
a Ref lex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for 
a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large 
one. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack 
rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The creature 
must be aware of the attack in order to make a rock 
catching attempt.
Format: rock catching; Location: Defensive Abilities.
Rock Throwing (Ex) This creature is an accomplished 
rock thrower and has a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls 
with thrown rocks. A creature can hurl rocks up to two 
categories smaller than its size; for example, a Large hill 
giant can hurl Small rocks. A “rock” is any large, bulky, and 
relatively regularly shaped object made of any material with 
a hardness of at least 5. The creature can hurl the rock up 
to five range increments. The size of the range increment 
varies with the creature. Damage from a thrown rock is 
generally twice the creature’s base slam damage plus 1-1/2 
its Strength bonus.
Format: rock throwing (120 ft.); Location: Special Attacks 
(damage is listed in Ranged attack). 303

Scent (Ex) This special quality allows a creature to detect 
approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by 
sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify 
familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.
The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by 
sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range 
increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. 
Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be 
detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering 
scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be 
detected at triple normal range.
When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of 
the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere 
within range. The creature can take a move action to note 
the direction of the scent. When the creature is within 5 
feet of the source, it pinpoints the source’s location.
A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks by 
smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or 
follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no 
matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC 
increases or decreases depending on how strong the 
quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age 
of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC 
increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for 
the Survival skill. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the 
effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
Format: scent; Location: Senses.
Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) Spell-like abilities are magical 
and work just like spells (though they are not spells and so 
have no verbal, somatic, focus, or material components). 
They go away in an antimagic field and are subject to spell 
resistance if the spell the ability is based on would be 
subject to spell resistance.
A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it 
can be used. A constant spell-like ability or one that can 
be used at will has no use limit. Reactivating a constant 
spell-like ability is a swift action. Using all other spell-
like abilities is a standard action unless noted otherwise, 
and doing so provokes attacks of opportunity. It is possible 
to make a concentration check to use a spell-like ability 
defensively and avoid provoking an attack of opportunity, 
just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability can be 
disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot 
be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.
For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated 
caster level defines how difficult it is to dispel their 
spell-like effects and to define any level-dependent 
variables (such as range and duration) the abilities might 
have. The creature’s caster level never affects which 
spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the given 
caster level is lower than the level a spellcasting character 
would need to cast the spell of the same name. If no caster 
level is specified, the caster level is equal to the creature’s 

Hit Dice. The saving throw (if any) against a spell-like 
ability is 10 + the level of the spell the ability resembles or 
duplicates + the creature’s Charisma modifier.
Some spell-like abilities duplicate spells that work 
differently when cast by characters of different classes. 
A monster’s spell-like abilities are presumed to be the 
sorcerer/wizard versions. If the spell in question is not a 
sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to cleric, druid, bard, 
paladin, and ranger, in that order.
Format: At will—burning hands (DC 13); Location: Spell-
Like Abilities.
Spell Resistance (Ex) A creature with spell resistance 
can avoid the effects of spells and spell-like abilities that 
directly affect it. To determine if a spell or spell-like 
ability works against a creature with spell resistance, 
the caster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster 
level). If the result equals or exceeds the creature’s 
spell resistance, the spell works normally, although the 
creature is still allowed a saving throw.
Format: SR 18; Location: Defensive Abilities.
Stench (Ex) A creature with the stench special ability 
secretes an oily chemical that nearly every other creature 
finds offensive. All living creatures (except those with 
the stench special ability) within 30 feet must succeed on 
a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 stench creature’s racial HD 
+ stench creature’s Con modifier; the exact DC is given 
in the creature’s descriptive text) or be sickened. The 
duration of the sickened condition is given in the creature’s 
descriptive text. Creatures that successfully save cannot be 
affected by the same creature’s stench for 24 hours. A delay 
poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the 
sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are 
unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their 
normal bonus on their saving throws.
Format: stench (DC 15, 10 rounds); Location: Aura.
Summon (Sp) A creature with the summon ability 
can summon other specific creatures of its kind much 
as though casting a summon monster spell, but it usually 
has only a limited chance of success (as specified in the 
creature’s entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers 
the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return 
whence they came after 1 hour. A creature summoned in this 
way cannot use any spells or spell-like abilities that require 
material components costing more than 1 gp unless those 
components are supplied, nor can it use its own summon 
ability for 1 hour. An appropriate spell level is given for each 
summoning ability for purposes of Will saves, caster level 
checks, and concentration checks. No experience points are 
awarded for defeating summoned monsters.
Format: 1/day—summon (level 4, 1 hezrou 35%); Location: 
Spell-Like Abilities.
Swallow Whole (Ex) If a creature with this special 
attack begins its turn with an opponent grappled in its 

304

304

mouth (see Grab), it can attempt a new combat maneuver 
check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it 
succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite 
damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up 
to one size category smaller than the swallowing creature. 
Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each 
round. The amount and type of damage varies and is 
given in the creature’s statistics. A swallowed creature 
keeps the grappled condition, while the creature that 
did the swallowing does not. A swallowed creature can 
try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing 
weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get 
free is equal to 1/10 the creature’s total hit points), or it 
can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of 
the interior of a creature that swallows whole is normally 
10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for 
size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, 
the swallowing creature cannot use swallow whole again 
until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature 
escapes the grapple, success puts it back in the attacker’s 
mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.
Format: swallow whole (5d6 acid damage, AC 15, 18 hp); 
Location: Special Attacks.
Telepathy (Su) The creature can mentally communicate 
with any other creature within a certain range (specified 
in the creature’s entry, usually 100 feet) that has a 
language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at 
once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic 
conversation with more than one creature at a time is just 
as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to 
multiple people at the same time.
Format: telepathy 100 ft.; Location: Languages.
Trample (Ex) As a full-round action, a creature with the 
trample ability can attempt to overrun any creature that 
is at least one size category smaller than itself. This works 
just like the overrun combat maneuver, but the trampling 
creature does not need to make a check, it merely has to 
move over opponents in its path. Targets of a trample take 
an amount of damage equal to the trampling creature’s slam 
damage + 1-1/2 times its Str modifier. Targets of a trample 
can make an attack of opportunity, but at a –4 penalty. If 
targets forgo an attack of opportunity, they can attempt to 
avoid the trampling creature and receive a Ref lex save to 
take half damage. The save DC against a creature’s trample 
attack is 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD + creature’s Str modifier 
(the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). 
A trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to 
each target once per round, no matter how many times its 
movement takes it over a target creature.
Format: trample (2d6+9, DC 20); Location: Special 
Attacks.
Tremorsense (Ex) A creature with tremorsense is 
sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically 

pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with 
the ground. Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can 
also sense the location of creatures moving through 
water. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s 
descriptive text.
Format: tremorsense 60 ft.; Location: Senses.
Trip (Ex) A creature with the trip special attack can 
attempt to trip its opponent as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity if it hits with the 
specified attack. If the attempt fails, the creature is not 
tripped in return.
Format: trip (bite); Location: individual attacks.
Undead Traits (Ex) Undead are immune to death 
effects, disease, mind-affecting effects (charms, 
compulsions, morale effects, phantasms, and patterns), 
paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and any effect that requires 
a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects 
or is harmless). Undead are not subject to ability drain, 
energy drain, or nonlethal damage. Undead are immune 
to damage or penalties to their physical ability scores 
(Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), as well as to 
fatigue and exhaustion effects. Undead are not at risk of 
death from massive damage.
Format: undead traits; Location: Immune.
Vulnerabilties (Ex or Su) A creature with vulnerabilities 
takes half again as much damage (+50%) from a specific 
energy type, regardless of whether a saving throw is 
allowed or if the save is a success or failure. Creatures 
with a vulnerability that is not an energy type instead 
take a –4 penalty on saves against spells and effects 
that cause or use the listed vulnerability (such as spells 
with the light descriptor). Some creatures might suffer 
additional effects, as noted in their descriptions.
Format: vulnerability to fire; Location: Weaknesses.
Web (Ex) Creatures with the web ability can use webs 
to support themselves and up to one additional creature 
of the same size. In addition, such creatures can throw a 
web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack 
with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a 
range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets 
up to one size category larger than the web spinner. An 
entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape 
Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check. Both 
are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 creature’s 
HD + creature’s Con modifier. Attempts to burst a web by 
those caught in it suffer a –4 penalty.
Web spinners can create sheets of sticky webbing up 
to three times their size. They usually position these 
sheets to snare f lying creatures but can also try to trap 
prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed 
on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise 
they stumble into it and become trapped as though by 
a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the 305

305

webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has 
something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 
5-foot-square section of web has a number of hit points 
equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that created it and 
DR 5/—.
A creature can move across its own web at its climb 
speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature 
touching its web.
Format: web (+8 ranged, DC 16, 5 hp); Location: Special 
Attacks.
Whirlwind (Su) Some creatures can transform 
themselves into whirlwinds and remain in that form for 
up to 1 round for every 2 HD they have. If the creature has 
a f ly speed, it can continue to f ly at that same speed while 
in whirlwind form, otherwise it gains a f ly speed equal 
to its base land speed (average maneuverability) while in 
whirlwind form.
The whirlwind is always 5 feet wide at its base, but its 
height and width at the top vary from creature to creature 
(minimum 10 feet high). A whirlwind’s width at its peak 
is always equal to half of its height. The creature controls 
the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet high.
The whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of 
opportunity, even if the creature enters the space another 
creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in 
the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if 
the whirlwind moves into or through a creature’s space. 
A creature in whirlwind form cannot make its normal 
attacks and does not threaten the area around it.
Creatures one or more size categories smaller than 
the whirlwind might take damage when caught in the 
whirlwind (generally damage equal to the monster’s 
slam attack for a creature of its size) and may be lifted 
into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a 
Ref lex save (DC 10 + half monster’s HD + the monster’s 
Strength modifier) when it comes into contact with 
the whirlwind or take damage as if it were hit by the 
whirlwind creature’s slam attack. It must also succeed 
on a second Ref lex save or be picked up bodily and held 
suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 
the indicated damage each round. A creature that can 
f ly is allowed a Ref lex save each round to escape the 
whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave 
if the save is successful.
Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move 
except to go where the whirlwind carries them or to 
escape the whirlwind. Trapped creatures can otherwise 
act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check 
(DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the 
whirlwind take a –4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty 
on attack rolls. The whirlwind can have only as many 
creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the 
whirlwind’s volume. The whirlwind can eject any carried 

creatures whenever it wishes as a free action, depositing 
them in its space.
If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates 
a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the 
creature and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s 
height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, 
beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while 
those farther away have total concealment. Those caught 
in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration 
check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.
Format: whirlwind (3/day, 10–30 ft. high, 1d6+6 damage, 
DC 15); Location: Special Attacks.
Creature	types
Each creature has one type, which broadly defines its 
abilities. Some creatures also have one or more subtypes, 
as described on pages 310–314. A creature cannot violate 
the rules of its subtype without a special ability or quality 
to explain the difference—templates can often change a 
creature’s type drastically.

hUMAnOID
A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one 
head, or a human-like torso, arms, and a head. Humanoids 
have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but 
most can speak and usually have well-developed societies.  
They are usually Small or Medium (with the exception 
of giants). Every humanoid creature also has a specific 
subtype to match its race, such as human, giant, goblinoid, 
reptilian, or tengu.
Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their 
humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class. 
Humanoids of this sort are typically presented as 1st-level 
warriors, which means they have average combat ability and 
poor saving throws. Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die 
are the only humanoids who make use of the features of the 
humanoid type. A humanoid has the following features (unless 
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
•	d8	Hit	Die,	or	by	character	class.
•	Base	attack	bonus	equal	to	3/4	total	Hit	Dice	(medium	
progression).
•	One	good	save,	usually	Reflex.
•	Skill	points	equal	to	2	+	Int	modifier	(minimum	1)	per	Hit	
Die or by character class.  The following are class skills 
for humanoids without a character class: Climb, Craft, 
Handle Animal, Heal, Profession, Ride, and Survival. 
Humanoids with a character class use their class’s skill 
list instead.
Traits: A humanoid possesses the following traits (unless 
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
•	Proficient	with	all	simple	weapons,	or	by	character	class.
•	Proficient	with	whatever	type	of	armor	(light,	medium,	
or heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character class. 
If a humanoid does not have a class and wears armor, 
it is proficient with that type of armor and all lighter 
types. Humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are 
not proficient with armor. Humanoids are proficient with

OUTSIDER
An outsider is at least partially composed of the 
essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane 
other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out as 
some other type and become outsiders when they attain 
a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence. An outsider 
has the following features.
•	d10	Hit	Dice.
•	Base	attack	bonus	equal	to	total	Hit	Dice	(fast	progression).
•	Two	good	saving	throws,	usually	Reflex	and	Will.
•	Skill	points	equal	to	6	+	Int	modifier	(minimum	1)	per	
Hit Die. The following are class skills for outsiders: Bluff, 
Craft, Knowledge (planes), Perception, Sense Motive, and 
Stealth. Due to their varied nature, outsiders also receive 4 
additional class skills determined by the creature’s theme.
Traits: An outsider possesses the following traits (unless 
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
•	Darkvision	60	feet.
•	Unlike	most	living	creatures,	an	outsider	does	not	have	a	
dual nature—its soul and body form one unit. When an 
outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore 
souls to their bodies, such as raise dead, reincarnate, and 
resurrection, don’t work on an outsider. It takes a different 
magical effect, such as limited wish, wish, miracle, or true 
resurrection to restore it to life. An outsider with the native 

subtype can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as 
other living creatures can be.
•	Proficient	with	all	simple	and	martial	weapons	and	any	
weapons mentioned in its entry.
•	Proficient	with	whatever	type	of	armor	(light,	medium,	or	
heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. 
Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient 
with armor. Outsiders are proficient with shields if they are 
proficient with any form of armor.
•	Outsiders	breathe,	but	do	not	need	to	eat	or	sleep	
(although they can do so if they wish). Native outsiders 
breathe, eat, and sleep. 
PLAnT
This type comprises vegetable creatures. Note 
that regular plants, such as one finds growing in gardens 
and fields, lack Wisdom and Charisma scores and are not 
creatures, but objects, even though they are alive. A plant 
creature has the following features. 
•	d8	Hit	Die.
•	Base	attack	bonus	equal	to	3/4	total	Hit	Dice	(medium	
progression).
•	Good	Fortitude	saves.
•	Skill	points	equal	to	2	+	Int	modifier	(minimum	1)	per	Hit	
Die. Some plant creatures, however, are mindless and gain 
no skill points or feats. The following are class skills for 
plants: Perception and Stealth.
Traits: A plant creature possesses the following traits (unless 
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
•	Low-light	vision.
•	Immunity	to	all	mind-affecting	effects	(charms,	
compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms).
•	Immunity	to	paralysis,	poison,	polymorph,	sleep	effects,	
and stunning.
•	Proficient	with	its	natural	weapons	only.
•	Not	proficient	with	armor.
•	Plants	breathe	and	eat,	but	do	not	sleep.
UnDEAD
Undead are once-living creatures animated by spiritual 
or supernatural forces. An undead creature has the following 
features.
•	d8	Hit	Die.
•	Base	attack	bonus	equal	to	3/4	total	Hit	Dice	(medium	
progression).
•	Good	Will	saves.
•	Skill	points	equal	to	4	+	Int	modifier	(minimum	1)	per	Hit	
Die. Many undead, however, are mindless and gain no skill 
points or feats. The following are class skills for undead: 
Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcane), 
Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, 
and Stealth.
Traits: An undead creature possesses the following traits 309

ppendices

(unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
•	No	Constitution	score.	Undead	use	their	Charisma	score	
in place of their Constitution score when calculating 
hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special ability that 
relies on Constitution (such as when calculating a breath 
weapon’s DC).
•	Darkvision	60	feet.
•	Immunity	to	all	mind-affecting	effects	(charms,	
compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms).
•	Immunity	to	death	effects,	disease,	paralysis,	poison,	sleep	
effects, and stunning.
•	Not	subject	to	nonlethal	damage,	ability drain, or energy 
drain. Immune to damage to its physical ability scores 
(Constitution, Dexterity, and Strength), as well as to 
exhaustion and fatigue effects.
•	Cannot	heal	damage	on	its	own	if	it	has	no	Intelligence	
score, although it can be healed. Negative energy (such 
as an inflict spell) can heal undead creatures. The fast 
healing special quality works regardless of the creature’s 
Intelligence score.
•	Immunity	to	any	effect	that	requires	a	Fortitude	save	(unless	
the effect also works on objects or is harmless).
•	Not	at	risk	of	death	from	massive	damage,	but	is	
immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.
•	Not	affected	by	raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities. 
Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead 
creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the 
living creatures they were before becoming undead.
•	Proficient	with	its	natural	weapons,	all	simple	weapons,	and	
any weapons mentioned in its entry.
•	Proficient	with	whatever	type	of	armor	(light,	medium,	or	
heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. 
Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient 
with armor. Undead are proficient with shields if they are 
proficient with any form of armor.
•	Undead	do	not	breathe,	eat,	or	sleep.
VERMIn
This type includes insects, arachnids, other arthropods, 
worms, and similar invertebrates. Vermin have the following 
features.
•	d8	Hit	Die.
•	Base	attack	bonus	equal	to	3/4	total	Hit	Dice	(medium	
progression).
•	Good	Fortitude	saves.
•	Skill	points	equal	to	2	+	Int	modifier	(minimum	1)	per	Hit	
Die. Most vermin, however, are mindless and gain no skill 
points or feats. Vermin have no class skills.
Traits: Vermin possess the following traits (unless otherwise 
noted in a creature’s entry).
•	Mindless:	No	Intelligence	score,	and	immunity	to	all	mind-
affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, 
patterns, and phantasms). A vermin-like creature with an 

Intelligence score is usually either an animal or a magical 
beast, depending on its other abilities.
•	Darkvision	60	feet.
•	Proficient	with	its	natural	weapons	only.
•	Proficient	with	no	armor.
•	Vermin	breathe,	eat,	and	sleep.
Creature	subtypes
Some creatures have one or more subtypes. Subtypes add 
additional abilities and qualities to a creature. 
Air Subtype: This subtype is usually used for outsiders 
with a connection to the Elemental Plane of Air. Air 
creatures always have f ly speeds and usually have perfect 
maneuverability. Air creatures treat Fly as a class skill.
Angel Subtype: Angels are a race of celestials, or good 
outsiders, native to the good-aligned outer planes. An 
angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise 
noted in a creature’s entry).
•	Darkvision	60	feet	and	low-light	vision.
•	Immunity	to	acid,	cold,	and	petrification.
•	Resistance	to	electricity	10	and	fire	10.
•	+4	racial	bonus	on	saves	against	poison.
•	Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects 
created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 
def lection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on 
saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. 
Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil 
effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a 
radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel’s HD). The 
defensive benefits from the circle are not included in 
an angel’s statistics block.
•	Truespeech (Su) All angels can speak with any creature 
that has a language, as though using a tongues spell 
(caster level equal to angel’s Hit Dice). This ability is 
always active.
Aquatic Subtype: These creatures always have swim 
speeds and can move in water without making Swim 
checks. An aquatic creature can breathe water. It cannot 
breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality. 
Aquatic creatures always treat Swim as a class skill.
Archon Subtype: Archons are a race of celestials, or 
good outsiders, native to lawful good-aligned outer 
planes. An archon possesses the following traits (unless 
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
•	Darkvision	60	feet	and	low-light	vision.
•	Aura of Menace (Su) A righteous aura surrounds archons 
that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 
20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save 
to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type 
of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial 
bonus. Those who fail take a –2 penalty on attacks, AC, 
and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit 
the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has 

310

310

resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again 
by the same archon’s aura for 24 hours.
•	Immunity	to	electricity	and	petrification.
•	+4	racial	bonus	on	saves	against	poison.
•	Teleport (Su) Archons can use greater teleport at will, as 
the spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature 
can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of 
carried objects.
•	Truespeech (Su) All archons can speak with any creature 
that has a language, as though using a tongues spell 
(caster level 14th). This ability is always active.
Augmented Subtype: A creature receives this subtype 
when something (usually a template) changes its original 
type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) 
are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they 
take on an acquired template. The augmented subtype is 
always paired with the creature’s original type.
Azata Subtype: Azatas are a race of celestials, or good 
outsiders, native to chaotic good-aligned outer planes. 
An azata possesses the following traits (unless otherwise 
noted in a creature’s entry).
•	Darkvision	60	feet	and	low-light	vision.
•	Immunity	to	electricity	and	petrification.
•	Resistance	to	cold	10	and	fire	10.
•	Truespeech (Su) All azatas can speak with any creature 
that has a language, as though using a tongues spell 
(caster level 14th). This ability is always active.
Chaotic Subtype: This subtype is usually applied to 
outsiders native to the chaotically aligned outer planes. 
Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic 
alignments; however, if their alignments change they still 
retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment 
affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature 
had a chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment 
actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to 
its actual alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype 
overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and 
any weapons it wields are chaotically aligned (see Damage 
Reduction, page 299).
Cold Subtype: A creature with the cold subtype has 
immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire.
Demon Subtype: Demons are chaotic evil outsiders that 
call the Abyss their home. Demons possess a particular 
suite of traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s 
entry) as summarized here.
•	Immunity	to	electricity	and	poison.
•	Resistance	to	acid	10,	cold	10,	and	fire	10.
•	Summon (Sp) Demons share the ability to summon 
others of their kind, typically another of their type or 
a small number of less powerful demons. 
•	Telepathy.
•	Except	where	otherwise	noted,	demons	speak	Abyssal,	
Celestial, and Draconic.

•	A	demon’s	natural	weapons,	as	well	as	any	weapon	it	
wields, is treated as chaotic and evil for the purpose of 
resolving damage reduction
Devil Subtype: Devils are lawful evil outsiders that hail 
from the plane of Hell. Devils possess a particular suite of 
traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).
•	Immunity	to	fire	and	poison.
•	Resistance	to	acid	10	and	cold	10.
•	See in Darkness (Su) Some devils can see perfectly in 
darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper 
darkness spell.
•	Summon (Sp) Devils share the ability to summon others 
of their kind, typically another of their type or a small 
number of less-powerful devils.
•	Telepathy.
•	Except	when	otherwise	noted,	devils	speak	Celestial,	
Draconic, and Infernal.
•	A	devil’s	natural	weapons,	as	well	as	any	weapons	it	
wields, are treated as lawful and evil for the purpose of 
resolving damage reduction.
Dwarf Subtype: This subtype is applied to dwarves and 
creatures related to dwarves. Creatures with the dwarf 
subtype have darkvision 60 feet.
Earth Subtype: This subtype is usually used for 
outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of 
Earth. Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds, and 
most earth creatures can burrow through solid rock. Earth 
creatures with a burrow speed possess tremorsense.
Elemental Subtype: An elemental is a being composed 
entirely from one of the four classical elements: air, earth, 
fire, or water. An elemental has the following features.
•	Immunity	to	paralysis,	poison,	sleep	effects,	and	
stunning.
•	Not	subject	to	critical	hits	or	f lanking.	Does	not	take	
additional damage from precision-based attacks, such 
as sneak attack.
•	Proficient	with	natural	weapons	only,	unless	generally	
humanoid in form, in which case proficient with all 
simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
•	Proficient	with	whatever	type	of	armor	(light,	
medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as 
all lighter types. Elementals not indicated as wearing 
armor are not proficient with armor. Elementals are 
proficient with shields if they are proficient with any 
form of armor.
•	Elementals	do	not	breathe,	eat,	or	sleep.
Elf Subtype: This subtype is applied to elves and 
creatures related to elves. Creatures with the elf subtype 
have low-light vision.
Evil Subtype: This subtype is usually applied to 
outsiders native to the evil-aligned outer planes. Evil 
outsiders are also called fiends. Most creatures that have 
this subtype also have evil alignments; however, if their 311

311

AAppendices

ppendices

alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any 
effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with 
this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no 
matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also 
suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature 
with the evil subtype overcomes damage reduction as if 
its natural weapons and any weapons it wields are evil-
aligned (see Damage Reduction, page 299).
Extraplanar Subtype: This subtype is applied to any 
creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane. 
A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this 
subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries 
assume that encounters with creatures take place on the 
Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane 
is not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype 
(but would not have it when on its home plane). Every 
extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane 
mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as 
extraplanar are natives of the Material Plane, and they 
gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material 
Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when 
it is on a transitive plane, such as the Astral Plane, the 
Ethereal Plane, or the Plane of Shadow.
Fire Subtype: A creature with the fire subtype has 
immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold.
Giant Type: A giant is a humanoid creature of great 
strength, usually of at least Large size. Giants have a 
number of racial Hit Dice and never substitute such Hit 
Dice for class levels like some humanoids. Giants have 
low-light vision, and treat Intimidate and Perception as 
class skills.
Gnome Subtype: This subtype is applied to gnomes 
and creatures related to gnomes. Creatures with the 
gnome subtype have low-light vision.
Goblinoid Subtype: Goblinoids are stealthy humanoids 
who live by hunting and raiding and who all speak Goblin. 
Goblinoids treat Stealth as a class skill.
Good Subtype: This subtype is usually applied to 
outsiders native to the good-aligned outer planes. 
Most creatures that have this subtype also have good 
alignments; however, if their alignments change, they 
still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on 
alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if 
the creature has a good alignment, no matter what its 
alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects 
according to its actual alignment. A creature with the 
good subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its 
natural weapons and any weapons it wields are good-
aligned (see Damage Reduction, page 299).
Half ling Subtype: This subtype is applied to half lings 
and creatures related to half lings.
Human Subtype: This subtype is applied to humans 
and creatures related to humans.

Incorporeal Subtype: An incorporeal creature has 
no physical body. An incorporeal creature is immune 
to critical hits and precision-based damage (such as 
sneak attack damage) unless the attacks are made using 
a weapon with the ghost touch special weapon quality. In 
addition, creatures with the incorporeal subtype gain the 
incorporeal special quality.
Lawful Subtype: This subtype is usually applied to 
outsiders native to the lawfully aligned outer planes. 
Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful 
alignments; however, if their alignments change, they 
still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on 
alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the 
creature had a lawful alignment, no matter what its 
alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects 
according to its actual alignment. A creature with the 
lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its 
natural weapons and any weapons it wields are lawfully 
aligned (see Damage Reduction, page 299).
Native Subtype: This subtype is applied only to 
outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or 
a strong connection to the Material Plane and can be 
raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living 
creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are native 
to the Material Plane. Unlike true outsiders, native 
outsiders need to eat and sleep. 
Orc Subtype: This subtype is applied to orcs and 
creatures related to orcs, such as half-orcs. Creatures 
with the orc subtype have darkvision 60 feet and light 
sensitivity.
Reptilian Subtype: These creatures are scaly and 
usually cold-blooded. The reptilian subtype is only used 
to describe a set of humanoid races, not all animals and 
monsters that are true reptiles.
Shapechanger Subtype: A shapechanger has the 
supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate 
forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of 
shapeshifting, and not every creature that can change 
shapes has the shapechanger subtype. A shapechanger 
possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in 
a creature’s entry).
•	Proficient	with	its	natural	weapons,	with	simple	
weapons, and with any weapons mentioned in the 
creature’s description.
•	Proficient	with	any	armor	mentioned	in	the	creature’s	
description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of 
armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient 
with armor. A shapechanger is proficient with shields 
if it is proficient with any type of armor.
Swarm Subtype: A swarm is a collection of Fine, 
Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single 
creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, 
except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit 

312

312

Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single 
speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving 
throws as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a 
square (if it is made up of nonf lying creatures) or a cube 
(of f lying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 
feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, 
it moves into an opponent’s space, which provokes an 
attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as 
a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A 
swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies 
and vice versa without impediment, although the swarm 
provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm 
can move through cracks or holes large enough for its 
component creatures.
A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonf lying 
creatures or 1,000 f lying creatures. A swarm of 
Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonf lying 
creatures or 5,000 f lying creatures. A swarm of Fine 
creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are 
f lying or not. Swarms of nonf lying creatures include 
many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot 
square based on their normal space, because creatures 
in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally 
crawl over each other and their prey when moving or 
attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples 
of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm 
is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually 
remains in contiguous squares.
Swarm Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and 
no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical 
hits or f lanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures 
takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. 
A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is 
immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 
hit points or less causes it to break up, though damage 
taken until that point does not degrade its ability to 
attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or 
reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot 
be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot 
grapple an opponent.
A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets 
a specific number of creatures (including single-target 
spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of mind-
affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, 
patterns, and phantasms) if the swarm has an Intelligence 
score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much 
damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, 
such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.
Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are 
susceptible to high winds, such as those created by a gust 
of wind spell. For purposes of determining the effects of 
wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the 
same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered 

unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes 
disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until 
its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.
Swarm Attack: Creatures with the swarm subtype don’t 
make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic 
damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the 
end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm 
attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment 
or cover. A swarm’s statistics block has “swarm” in the 
Attack and Full Attack entries, with no attack bonus 
given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on 
its Hit Dice, as shown below.
Swarm hD Swarm Base Damage
1–5 1d6
6–10 2d6
11–15 3d6
16–20 4d6
21 or more 5d6
A swarm’s attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm’s 
description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient 
to reduce a swarm attack’s damage to 0, being incorporeal, 
or other special abilities usually give a creature immunity 
(or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some 
swarms also have acid, blood drain, poison, or other 
special attacks in addition to normal damage.
Swarms do not threaten creatures, and do not 
make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. 
However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, 
as described below.
Swarms possess the distraction universal monster rule. 
Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of 
a swarm requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). 
Using skills that involve patience and concentration 
requires a DC 20 Will save.
Water Subtype: This subtype is usually used for 
outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of 
Water. Creatures with the water subtype always have 
swim speeds and can move in water without making 
Swim checks. A water creature can breathe underwater 
and can usually breathe air as well. Water creatures treat 
the Swim skill as a class skill.
appendix	4:	Monsters	as	pCs
Using one of the monsters presented in this book as a 
character can be very rewarding, but weighing such a 
character against others is challenging. Monsters are not 
designed with the rules for players in mind, and as such 
can be very unbalancing if not handled carefully.
There are a number of monsters in this book that do 
not possess racial Hit Dice. Such creatures are the best 
options for player characters, but a few of them are so 313

powerful that they count as having 1 class level, even 
without a racial Hit Die. Such characters should only be 
allowed in a group that is 2nd-level or higher. 
For monsters with racial Hit Dice, the best way to 
allow monster PCs is to pick a CR and allow all of the 
players to make characters using monsters of that CR. 
Treat the monster’s CR as its total class levels and allow 
the characters to multiclass into the core classes. Do not 
advance such monsters by adding Hit Dice. Monster PCs 
should only advance through classes.
If you are including a single monster character in a 
group of standard characters, make sure the group is of 
a level that is at least as high as the monster’s CR. Treat 
the monster’s CR as class levels when determining the 
monster PC’s overall levels. For example, in a group of 
6th-level characters, a minotaur (CR 4) would possess 2 
levels of a core class, such as barbarian.
Note that in a mixed group, the value of racial Hit 
Dice and abilities diminish as a character gains levels. 
It is recommended that for every 3 levels gained by the 
group, the monster character should gain an extra level, 
received halfway between the 2nd and 3rd levels. Repeat 
this process a number of times equal to half the monster’s 
CR, rounded down. Using the minotaur example, when 
the group is at a point between 6th and 7th level, the 
minotaur gains a level, and then again at 7th, making 
him a minotaur barbarian 4. This process repeats at 
10th level, making him a minotaur barbarian 8 when 
the group reaches 10th level. From that point onward, he 
gains levels normally.
GMs should carefully consider any monster PCs in 
their groups. Some creatures are simply not suitable 
for play as PCs, due to their powers or role in the 
game. As monster characters progress, GMs should 
closely monitor whether such characters are disruptive 
or abusive to the rules and modify them as needed to 
improve play.
appendix	5:	Monster	feats
Most of the following Feats apply specifically to monsters, 
although some player characters might qualify for them 
(particularly Craft Construct).
Ability Focus
One of this creature’s special attacks is particularly difficult 
to resist. 
Prerequisite: Special attack.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s special attacks. 
Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against the special 
attack on which the creature focuses.
Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. 
Its effects do not stack. Each time the creature takes the 
feat, it applies to a different special attack.

Awesome Blow (Combat)
This creature can send opponents f lying.
Prerequisites: Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull 
Rush, size Large or larger.
Benefit: As a standard action, the creature may perform 
an awesome blow combat manuever. If the creature’s 
maneuver succeeds against a corporeal opponent smaller 
than itself, its opponent is knocked f lying 10 feet in a 
direction of the attacking creature’s choice and falls 
prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent 
in a straight line, and the opponent can’t move closer to 
the attacking creature than the square it started in. If an 
obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move, 
the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of 
damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space 
adjacent to the obstacle.
Craft Construct (Item Creation)
You can create construct creatures like golems.
Prerequisites: Caster level 5th, Craft Magic Arms and 
Armor, Craft Wondrous Item.
Benefit: You can create any construct whose 
prerequisites you meet. The act of animating a construct 
takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To 
create a construct, you must use up raw materials costing 
half of its base price, plus the full cost of the basic body 
created for the construct. Each construct has a special 
section that summarizes its costs and other prerequisites. 
A newly created construct has average hit points for its 
Hit Dice.
Empower Spell-Like Ability
One of this creature’s spell-like abilities is particularly 
potent and powerful.
Prerequisite: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s spell-like abilities, 
subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use 
that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times 
per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once 
or twice per day).
When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, 
all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are 
increased by half (+50%). Saving throws and opposed 
rolls are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random 
variables are not affected.
The creature can only select a spell-like ability 
duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 
its caster level (round down) – 2. For a summary, see the 
table in the description of the Quicken Spell-Like Ability 
feat on page 316. 
Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each 
time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different 
spell-like ability.

314

314

Flyby Attack
This creature can make an attack before and after it 
moves while f lying.
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefit: When f lying, the creature can take a move 
action and another standard action at any point during 
the move. The creature cannot take a second move action 
during a round when it makes a f lyby attack.
Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a standard 
action either before or after its move.
Hover
This creature can hover in place with ease and can kick 
up clouds of dust and debris.
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefit: A creature with this feat can halt its movement 
while f lying, allowing it to hover without needing to 
make a Fly skill check. 
If a creature of size Large or larger with this feat hovers 
within 20 feet of the ground in an area with lots of loose 
debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical 
cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds generated can 
snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and 
other small, open f lames of non-magical origin. Clear 
vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures 
have concealment at 15 to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 
25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment (50% 
miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate 
the creature).
Normal: Without this feat, a creature must make a Fly 
skill check to hover and the creature does not create a 
cloud of debris while hovering.
Improved Natural Armor
This creature’s hide is tougher than most.
Prerequisites: Natural armor, Con 13.
Benefit: The creature’s natural armor bonus increases 
by +1.
Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times. 
Each time the creature takes the feat, its natural armor 
bonus increases by another point.
Improved Natural Attack
Attacks made by one of this creature’s natural attacks 
leave vicious wounds.
Prerequisite: Natural weapon, base attack bonus +4.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s natural attack forms. 
The damage for this natural attack increases by one step on 
the following list, as if the creature’s size had increased by 
one category. Damage dice increase as follows: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 
1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6. 
A weapon or attack that deals 1d10 points of damage 
increases as follows: 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8, 6d8, 8d8, 12d8.

Multiattack (Combat)
This creature is particularly skilled at making attacks 
with its natural weapons.
Prerequisite: Three or more natural attacks.
Benefit: The creature’s secondary attacks with natural 
weapons take only a –2 penalty.
Normal: Without this feat, the creature’s secondary 
attacks with natural weapons take a –5 penalty.
Multiweapon Fighting (Combat)
This multi-armed creature is skilled at making attacks 
with multiple weapons.
Prerequisites: Dex 13, three or more hands.
Benefit: Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons 
are reduced by –2 with the primary hand and by –6 with 
off hands.
Normal: A creature without this feat takes a –6 penalty 
on attacks made with its primary hand and a –10 penalty 
on attacks made with all of its off hands. (It has one 
primary hand, and all the others are off hands.) See Two-
Weapon Fighting in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.
Special: This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Fighting 
feat for creatures with more than two arms.
Quicken Spell-Like Ability
This creature can use one of its spell-like abilities with 
next to no effort.
Prerequisite: Spell-like ability at CL 10th or higher.
Benefit: Choose one of the creature’s spell-like 
abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this 
feat. The creature can use the chosen spell-like ability 
as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or 
less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice 
per day).
Using a quickened spell-like ability is a swift action 
that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The 
creature can perform another action—including the 
use of another spell-like ability (but not another swift 
action)—in the same round that it uses a quickened spell-
like ability. The creature may use only one quickened 
spell-like ability per round.
The creature can only select a spell-like ability 
duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 
its caster level (round down) – 4. For a summary, see the 
table on page 316.
A spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting 
time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.
Normal: The use of a spell-like ability normally 
requires a standard action (at the very least) and provokes 
an attack of opportunity.
Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each 
time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one 
of its spell-like abilities. 315

Snatch
This creature can grab other creatures with ease.
Prerequisite: Size Huge or larger.
Benefits: The creature can start a grapple when it 
hits with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the 
grab ability. If it grapples a creature three or more 
sizes smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic 
bite or claw damage with a successful grapple check. 
A snatched opponent held in the creature’s mouth is 
not allowed a Ref lex save against the creature’s breath 
weapon, if it has one.
The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a 
free action or use a standard action to f ling it aside. A 
f lung creature travels 1d6 × 10 feet, and takes 1d6 points 
of damage per 10 feet traveled. If the creature f lings a 
snatched opponent while f lying, the opponent takes this 
amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.
Wingover
This creature can make turns with ease while f lying.
Prerequisite: Fly speed.
Benefits: Once each round, a creature with this feat can 
turn up to 180 degrees as a free action without making 
a Fly skill check. This free turn does not consume any 
additional movement from the creature.
Normal: A f lying creature can turn up to 90 degrees 
by making a DC 15 Fly skill check and expending 5 feet of 
movement. A f lying creature can turn up to 180 degrees 
by making a DC 20 Fly skill check and expending 10 feet 
of movement.
appendix	6:	Monster	Cohorts
The Leadership feat (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 
page 129) allows a character to gain a loyal cohort. With 
the GM’s approval, this cohort can be a similarly aligned 
monster rather than a humanoid with the appropriate 
number of class levels. Monsters on the following 
list all work well as cohorts (be they bodyguards, 
mounts, assassins, etc.)—their effective cohort “level” 

corresponds to the level available to the PC as afforded 
by his Leadership score.
A monster cohort gains experience points as if it were a 
character of its cohort level, and when it gains enough XP 
to advance a level, it should generally gain a key class level 
(fighter is often the best choice for most cohorts). You can 
use the monsters on the following table as guidelines 
when determining effective cohort levels for monsters 
not on this list.
Monster Cohorts
Monster Level Monster Level
Babau (demon) 11 Hound archon 7
Bralani (azata) 11 Manticore 9
Young dragon Special* Pegasus 6
Drider 11 Pixie 8
Erinyes (devil) 16 Satyr 7
Ettin 15 Skeletal champion 6
Ghoul 5 Stone giant 18
Giant eagle 6 Unicorn 8
Griffon 8 Worg 5
Hell hound 7 Wyvern 10
* A young dragon’s effective cohort level equals its CR + 
8. Dragon cohorts do not advance via aging as normal 
dragons do, but by gaining class levels (typically in fighter 
or sorcerer).
appendix	7:	aniMal	CoMpanions
The Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook presents druids and 
rangers with a wide selection of animal companion 
choices, but this selection by no means covers the entirety 
of animals available as companions. Numerous additional 
animals are presented in this book, and in each case, 
rules for using them as companions are included. The 
following list indexes all additional animal companions 
found in this book, along with the page numbers on 
which they can be located.

appendix	10:	Monsters	by	terrain
The following lists group all of the monsters in this book 
into their respective terrains. Note that there can be a certain 
amount of crossover on these lists, especially between 

climate bands, similar terrains, or a planar terrain and the 
Materal Plane. For example, although behirs are normally 
encountered in warm deserts, it’s certainly possible to 
encounter one in a temperate desert (but much less likely to 
find one in a cold desert). Likewise, while bulettes usually 
limit their hunts to hilly terrain, it wouldn’t be unusual to 
find one in the mountains or even on a plain. Creatures listed 
under planar terrains can usually be encountered anywhere 
on the Material Plane as well, but are only very rarely 
encountered on planes other than the one associated with 
them. In short, use these lists as a guide, not as shackles—if 
your adventure works better with a sphinx encountered in 
a cold forest, by all means, go for it! Just keep in mind that 
you should also probably come up with an in-game reason 
to explain the monster’s presence there.

variant	Monster	index
Not all of the monsters presented in this book have 
their own stat blocks. Many of them are merely variants 
on a theme, be they aquatic ghouls like lacedons, more 
powerful versions of efreeti known as maliks, advanced 
sharks like the great white, or alternate versions like the 
fast zombie and the plague zombie. Monster variants use 
the standard monster’s stats but with specific changes, 
as outlined in the text. The following list indexes all 
of the monster variants in this book that are associated 
with rules changes (creatures that are only mentioned in 
passing, such as the mature form of a nabasu demon or 
the possibility of other types of kytons or rakshasas, are 
not indexed here).

appendix	12:	ability	index
The monsters detailed in this book have a wide range 
of special attacks, defenses, and qualities—and only in 
the case of relatively unique abilities are rules given in 
a monster’s actual entry. Other abilities are detailed in 
the universal monster rules, in shared abilities for that 
creature’s type, or even as class abilities or other features 
detailed in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Use the 
following ability index to track down full rules for monster 
abilities not detailed in their entry.
Note: Entries listed in bold are usually class abilities, 
and thus the page number listed refers to a page in the 
Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. All other page number 
references point to pages in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.

appendix	13:	Monster	roles
The following lists categorize all of the monsters in this 
book into their roles, as detailed on page 297. These roles 
indicate what types of character classes are treated as key 
classes for each monster.
Combat monsters are good at ranged and melee combat. 
Spell monsters have an inherent ability to cast magic 
spells. Skill monsters are particularly adept at ambushing 
prey, use sneak attacks, or have bard-like powers. Special 
monsters have no key classes—their focus is on unique 
tactics and abilities.
Creatures listed as having “Any Role” do not use special 
rules when advancing via class level—they lack racial Hit 
Dice, and thus advance in level normally, as detailed in 
the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. All of the PC races listed 
in that book fit into this category as well.
Creatures listed in the “No Role” category have no 
key classes—these are generally any creatures that are 
mindless or have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. 
Unlike Special creatures (which also have no key classes), 
creatures in this category cannot gain class levels at all, 
and must advance using other methods. If a creature in 
this category gains an Intelligence of 3 or higher, the 
creature becomes a Combat Role monster.
Note that monster templates are not listed in this 
appendix—with the exception of skeletons and zombies 
(which lose their intelligence and thus have no key 
classes), a templated monster’s key class is the same as 
the base creature’s key classes.

appendix	14:	enCounter	tables
At times during a game when you’re looking to liven things up 
(perhaps during a long overland journey, or maybe when the 
party’s decided to camp in a dangerous dungeon), you can use 
the following encounter tables to randomly generate monster 
encounters. These tables do not include all of the monsters in 
this book—likewise, they don’t cover all possible locations the 
PCs might find themselves in during the course of a game, but 
you can use these tables as models for generating additional 
encounter tables of your own design. Note that each of the 
following tables has been assigned a CR score—this indicates 
the average difficulty of the encounters that can be rolled up on 
the table. A CR 4 encounter table works well when challenging 
a group of 4th level PCs, for example.

CORE RULEBOOK

Available 
Now!

hat is a hero without monsters to vanquish? This book presents hundreds of different 
creatures for use in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Within this tome you’ll find 
fire-breathing dragons and blood-drinking vampires, vile demons and shapechanging 
werewolves, sadistic goblins and lumbering giants, and so much 
more! Yet not all the creatures in this book are enemies, for some 
can serve lucky heroes as allies or advisors, be they summoned 
angels or capricious nymphs. And it doesn’t stop there—with 
full rules for advancing monsters, adapting monsters to different 
roles, and designing your own unique creations, you’ll never be 
without a band of hideous minions again!
 The Pathfinder RPG Bestiary is the must-have companion volume 
to the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. This imaginative tabletop 
game builds upon more than 10 years of system development 
and an Open Playtest featuring more than 50,000 gamers to 
create a cutting-edge RPG experience that brings the all-time 
best-selling set of fantasy rules into the new millennium.
The Pathfinder RPG Bestiary includes:
• More than 350 different monsters
• Dozens of monstrous variants to modify creatures and keep 
players on their toes
• Numerous lists of monsters to aid in navigation, including lists 
by Challenge Rating, monster type, and habitat
• Extensive rules for creating effective and balanced monsters
• Rules for advancing monsters by hit dice, template, or class level
• Universal monster rules to simplify special attacks, defenses, and 
qualities like breath weapons, damage reduction, and regeneration
• More than a dozen Feats tailored especially for monsters
• Suggestions for monstrous cohorts
• Two dozen additional animal companions
• More than a dozen different wandering monster encounter tables
• AND MUCH, MUCH MORE!
