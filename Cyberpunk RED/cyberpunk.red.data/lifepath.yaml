family_background:
  - name: Corporate Execs

  - name: Corporate Managers
    desc: Well to do, with large homes, safe neighborhoods, nice cars, etc. Sometimes your parent(s) would hire servants, although this was rare. You had a mix of private and corporate education.
  - name: Corporate Technicians
    desc: Middle -middle class, with comfortable conapts or Beaverville suburban homes, minivans and corporate -run technical schools. Kind of like living 1950s America crossed with 1984.
  - name: Nomad Pack
    desc: You had a mix of rugged trailers, vehicles, and huge road kombis for your home. You learned to drive and fight at an early age, but the family was always there to care for you. Food was actually fresh and abundant. Mostly home schooled.
  - name: Ganger "Family"
    desc: A savage, violent home in any place the gang could take over. You were usually hungry, cold, and scared. You probably didn't know who your actual parents were. Education? The Gang taught you how to fight, kill, and steal—what else did you need to know?
  - name: Combat Zoners
    desc: A step up from a gang "family," your home was a decaying building somewhere in the ‘Zone', heavily fortified. You were hungry at times, but regularly could score a bed and a meal. Home schooled.
  - name: Urban Homeless
    desc: You lived in cars, dumpsters, or abandoned shipping modules. If you were lucky. You were usually hungry, cold, and scared, unless you were tough enough to fight for the scraps. Education? School of Hard Knocks
  - name: Megastructure Warren Rats
    desc: You grew up in one of the huge new megastructures that went up after the War. A tiny conapt, kibble and scop for food, a mostly warm bed. Some better educated adult warren dwellers or a local Corporation may have set up a school.
  - name: Reclaimers
    desc: You started out on the road, but then moved into one of the deserted ghost towns or cities to rebuild it. A pioneer life - dangerous, but with plenty of simple food and a safe place to sleep. You were home schooled if there was anyone who had the time.
  - name: Edgerunners
    desc: Your home was always changing based on your parents' current "job." Could be a luxury apartment, an urban conapt, or a dumpster if you were on the run. Food and shelter ran the gamut from gourmet to kibble.
