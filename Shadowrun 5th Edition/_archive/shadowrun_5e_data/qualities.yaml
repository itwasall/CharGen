  - name: Ambidextrous
    karma_cost: 4
    desc: The Ambidextrous character can handle objects equally well with either hand. Without this quality, any action performed solely with the off-hand (i.e., firing a gun) suffers a -2 dice pool modifier (see Attacker Using Off-Hand Weapon, p. 178)
    flags: [NO_OFFHAND_PENALTY]
  - name: Analytical Mind
    karma_cost: 5
    desc: Analytical Mind describes the uncanny ability to logically analyze information, deduce solutions to problems, or separate vital information from distractions and noise. It's useful in cracking cyphers, solving puzzles, figuring out traps, and sifting through data. This quality gives the character a +2 dice pool modifier to any Logic Tests involving pattern recognition, evidence analysis, clue hunting, or solving puzzles. This quality also reduces the time it takes the character to solve a problem by half.

    mod_attribute: [Test, Logic]
  - name: Aptitude
    karma_cost: 14
    desc: This quality is how you become even better than the best in the world. The standard limit for skills is 12. Every so often, there is a character who can exceed limitations and be truly exceptional in a particular skill.  With this particular quality, the character can have one skill rated at 7 at character creation, and may eventually build that skill up to rating 13. Characters may only take the Aptitude quality once

  - name: Astral Chameleon
    karma_cost: 10
    desc: With the Astral Chameleon quality, the character's astral signature blends into the background of astral space and is difficult to detect. All signatures left by the character last only half as long as other astral signatures. Any individual assensing astral signatures left behind by a character with this quality recieve a -2 dice pool modifier for the Assensing Test. Only characters with a Magic rating and capable of leaving astral signatures may have this quality
    magic_only: true
    dice_pool_mod: -2
    mod_attribute: [Assensing Test]
  - name: Bilingual
    karma_cost: 5
    desc: "A character with this quality reads, writes and speaks a second language fluently. They can list a second language as a native tongue. This quality can only be acquired at character creation; selecing it gives a character a second free language skill during Step Five: Purchase Active, Knowledge and Language Skills"
    extra_language: true
  - name: Blandness
    karma_cost: 8
    desc: This character blends into a crowd; they're seldom noticed and easily forgotten. They are unremarkable in every aspect of physical appearance. Anyone attempting to describe the character cannot come up with anything more precise than "average height, average build, average hair etc." Increase the threshold for anyone to recall specific details about the character by 1. This means a Memory Test with a difficulty of Average (threshold of 2) becomes a Hard test (threshold of 3). Individuals attempting to shadow or physically locate a character with the Blandness quality in a populated setting recieve a 02 dice pool modifier on all testrelated to their search. The same penalty applies if the're asking around about the person based on the individual's physical appearance. The modifier does not, however, apply to magical or Matrix searches. If the character acquires any visible tattos, scars, obvious cyberware, or other distinguishing features, the bonuses from the Blandness quality go away until the distinctive features are removed from the character's appearance. In certain cirumstances and specific situations, the gamemaster may determine that Blandess does not apply. For example, a troll with the Blandess quality still towers head and shoulders over a crowd of humans and so still stands out, no matter how average their horns may be. The character only regains their bonus by leaving the situation where they stand out.

  - name: Catlike
    karma_cost: 7
    desc: A character with the Catlike quality is gifted with an uncanny elegance, a stealthy gait, and an almost preternatural ability to move without making a sound. They also claim they land on their feet when dropped, though they tend not to let people test this. This quality adds a +2 dice pool modifier to Sneaking skill tests.
