# CharGen
I didn't know how to start programming, so I attempted to make a bunch of TTRPG character generators

Work has stared on at least:
- Cyberpunk 2020
- Cyberpunk RED
- Dungeons & Dragons 3.5
- Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition
- Exalted 3rd Edition
- Kamigakari
- Mork Borg
- Numenera
- Pathfinder 1st Edition
- Pathfinder 2nd Edition
- Pokerole
- Ryuutama
- Savage Worlds
- Shadow of the Demon Lord
- Shadowrun 5e
- Shadowrun 6e
- Tenra Bansho Zero
- Werewolf the Apocolaypse

## Usage
If a file works (which most don't, as either I'm incompetent, they're unfinished, or I wrote these on linux and didn't think how the code would work on other operating systems), you should just be able to use
```bash
$ python chargen_dnd_5e.py
```
replacing *dnd_5e.py* with the suffix of the generator you want to run (or see fail to run)

## Working Generators
- char_dnd_5e_new.py
- char_mork_borg.py
- char_ryuutama.py

## Generators with Significant Progress
- char_shadowrun_5e.py
