# CharGen
I didn't know how to start programming, so I attempted to make a bunch of TTRPG character generators

Work has stared on at least:
- Cyberpunk 2020
- Cyberpunk RED
- Dungeons & Dragons 3.5
- Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition
- Exalted 3rd Edition
- Kamigakari
- Mork Borg
- Numenera
- Pathfinder 2nd Edition
- Pokerole
- Ryuutama
- Savage Worlds
- Tenra Bansho Zero
- Werewolf the Apocolaypse

## Usage
If a file works (which most don't, as either I'm incompetent, they're unfinished, or I wrote these on linux and didn't think how the code would work on other operating systems), you should just be able to use
```bash
$ python chargen_dnd_5e.py
```
replacing *dnd_5e.py* with the suffix of the generator you want to run (or see fail to run)

### File Breakdown
- char_cyberpunk_2020.py
  - The **CharGen** file for **Cyberpunk 2020**
  - A decent amount of data has been pulled in, most of it superflueous
- char_cyberpunk_red.py
  - The **CharGen** file for **

Cyberpunk 2020

## Cyberpunk RED
Progress unknown. Don't care enough to check

## DND 5e
Core Rulebook done

## DND 3.5e

Tests inconlusive, consider abandoned.
