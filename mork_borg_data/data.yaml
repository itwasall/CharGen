    uniques:
      Crumpled Monster Mask: Strikes primitive fear into lesser creatures like Goblins, Gnoums and Children. While worn, they check Morale every roound.
      The Brown Scimitar of Galgenbeck: A stinking sword you pulled from a military shit-ditch. 1d6 damage. DR10 attack and defence while you weild it. 1/6 chance a wounded enemy is smitten with potent sepsis, dying in 10 minutes.

      desc: You have thirty or so friends who never let you down: Your teeth. Disloyal, deranged, or simply uncontrollable, any group that didn't boot you out you left anyway. But your parliment of teeth - enormous, protruding, thick & sharp - have always been your allies.

      silver: ['1d6', 10] 
      omens: ['1d2']
    uniques:
      Coward’s Jab: When attacking by surprise test Agility DR10. On a success you automatically hit once with a light one-handed weapon, dealing normal damage +3.
      Filthy Fingersmith: Your snaky little digits get into pockets and pick locks with a DR8 Agility test. You also begin with lockpicks!
      Abominable Gob Lobber: Your phlegm is viscous, lumpy, vile and ballistically accurate at short range. You can spit d2 times during a fight. Roll a DR8 Presence test for accuracy. Targets are blinded, retching and vomiting for d4 rounds. Anyone witnessing this—friend and foe—must make a Toughness test to not  also vomit. PCs test DR10 and enemies DR12.
      Escaping Fate: Every time you use an omen there is a 50% chance it is not spent.
      Dodging Death: You are so unpleasant, irrelevant, disgusting and vile even Death would rather avoid you if it can.

If successful, after 10 rounds you pop back up with 1d4 HP and an unlikely explanation of your escape.
      Excretal Stealth: You have an astounding, almost preternatural ability to hide in muck, debris and filth. When hidden in these conditions a DR16 Presence test is required  to notice you.
