      Old Sigurd's Sling: Sigurd was the strongest man whose throat you ever gnawed. Woven from his long grey hair, this sling has never failed you. 2d4 damage, requires fist-sized rocks which, rehaps regrettably, are everywhere.
      Ancient Gore-Hound: Asthmatic, deluded and on its last legs, this wizened creature still has a superb nose and can sniffle up treasure in the most disgusting debris. Attacks with DR10 (bite 1d6). Defends with DR12, 10HP. Becomes frenzied around Goblins and Berserkers.
      The Shoe of Death's Horse: It looks normal but since finding it in an obscure crypt you are convied this shoe came from the horse of Death himself.

      Coward’s Jab: When attacking by surprise test Agility DR10. On a success you automatically hit once with a light one-handed weapon, dealing normal damage +3.
      Filthy Fingersmith: Your snaky little digits get into pockets and pick locks with a DR8 Agility test. You also begin with lockpicks!
      Abominable Gob Lobber: Your phlegm is viscous, lumpy, vile and ballistically accurate at short range. You can spit d2 times during a fight. Roll a DR8 Presence test for accuracy. Targets are blinded, retching and vomiting for d4 rounds. Anyone witnessing this—friend and foe—must make a Toughness test to not  also vomit. PCs test DR10 and enemies DR12.
      Escaping Fate: Every time you use an omen there is a 50% chance it is not spent.
      Dodging Death: You are so unpleasant, irrelevant, disgusting and vile even Death would rather avoid you if it can. On death, if there is even the slightest possibility that you  survived, there is a 50% chance that  you did. If successful, after 10 rounds you pop back up with 1d4 HP and an unlikely explanation of your escape.
      Excretal Stealth: You have an astounding, almost preternatural ability to hide in muck, debris and filth. When hidden in these conditions a DR16 Presence test is required  to notice you.

      - Master of Fate: What use are maps when the substance of causality itself is open to you? You know the right way with a DR8 Presence test.
      - A Book of Boiling Blood: You may open and read from this book once a day. Your enemy must make a DR12 test to prevent this. If they fail D2 Berserker-slayers appear from the depths of a forgotten dimension of blood. Roll a D6. On a 1–4 these creatures  ight alongside you. On a 5–6 they turn on you, attempting to kill you and destroy the book. After the battle they return to their imprisonment.
      - Speaker of Truths: Twice per day use your wisdom, knowledge, advice and inner calm to bring clarity to a creature of your choice. The DR of the next test they undertake is lowered by 4.
      - Initiate of the Invisible College: Once per day you may summon D2 scrolls, whose power can be used only once. Roll a d4, on a 1–2 the scrolls are sacred, on a 3–4, unclean. If the scrolls are not used before sunrise they turn to ash.
      - Bard of the Undying: You learnt your melodies in the Otherworld. The music of your Harp gives +D4 on reaction rolls.

    traits:
      Greedy: Take two unique items from the list
    uniques:
      - The Blade of your Ancestors: This magnificent and clearly magical talking sword is foppish, unreliable and quietly despises you. It taunts your failures and, if continually disappointed, develops a 1 in 6 chance to ‘accidentally’ attack you or your companions. Deals d6+1 damage. Attack/Defence DR is 10.
      - ‘Poltroon’ the Court Jester: While practically useless, personally irritating and an emotional drain, Poltroon’s capering actually makes enemies lose their focus in combat. For the first two rounds you and  your allies get +2 on attack/defence.
      - Barbarister the Incredible Horse: Barbarister is magical, intelligent, arrogant and vain. He can also talk. If you can persuade him to care, Barbarister occasionally adds +2 to Presence tests involving logic and intellect. The horse may be smarter than you and is quite aware of this.
      - Hamfund the Squire: This intensely cowardly servant acts only as guardian for the scabbard of the cursed sword Eurekia. Once per combat, if Ham can be found, Eurekia may be drawn. The sword does 2d6 damage,  and for every swing of Eurekia roll a d6. On a 1 the squire is slain and Eurekia vanishes forever.
      - The Snake-Skin Gift: An expensive sandalwood box bound in snakeskin. It contains a seemingly ordinary dagger, wrapped in silk. The dagger does d4 damage but on a 1 the target dies immediately of deadly poison  weeping from the blade.
      - Horn of the Schleswig Lords!: Once per day release a blare from this dented old trumpet and test Presence DR12. One creature may make their next non-combat test an automatic success.
  Heretical Priest:

    uniques:
      - Sacred shepherd’s crook: Its head a hook of human bone inscribed with overlapping anti-prayers. This crook hooks through other worlds. Staff does 2d4 damage except to faithless humans.
      - Stolen Mitre: While wearing this holy hat the priest’s vile body fades, becoming hard to hit in combat (Defence DR10). If pulled over the ears outside of battle the priest becomes nearly invisible, testing  stealth against DR8.
      - List of Sins: "A long and accurate document cross-referenced against reality to discover unseen evil-doers. Successful Presence DR10: A strange light surrounds evil creatures. The list’s owner defends with +2 against any being discovered this way."
      - The Blasphemous Nechrubel Bible: "So intensely blasphemous even the Priests themselves can only peruse it once per day. When read, roll a die. Even result: For the rest of the day PCs heal d4 HP after just five minutes of rest. Odd result: The priest is plagued by demonic hallucinations. The DM may invent d3 things that only the Priest can see and describe them to the player as if true. This effect ends with sunrise."
      - Stones taken from Thel-Emas’ Lost Temple: Cast the stones on the ground. Their pattern reveals if danger lurks in an adjacent room. The stones can lie. The priest tests Presence DR10 to see if they are true but after failing they cannot test again until the sun has set.
      - (WRONG JESUS) CRUCIFIX: The crucifix can be used in encounters with the undead as well as lesser trolls and goblins. Check morale (add or subtract the priest’s Presence modifier) to see if the creatures bow and kindly remove themselves

occult_treasures:
  - Ash-grey ring a finger-width wide- All that passes through is obliterated
  - The keening music of this small, vile flute animates a fetus-sized meat golem in a nearby corpse.
  - "A note explains: one taste from this Famine Spoon means death from slow starvation."
  - The image of a being in this malevolently-accurate mirror shows only the shameful truth of their soul.
  - "Vampiric phurba- Heals you as it harms your target (d3), but beware: after stealing a total of 6 HP, test Presence DR14 or becomeaddicted—you must then  test Presence DR12 daily- Fail and you must stab someone with the knife before next sunrise- Or wither to ash and die as the sun rises."
  - A black pearl- If dropped in darkness it rolls towards the nearest exit to day.
  - This torch burns for an immortal hour- Hold it and live- You can lose limbs and enter negative HP but won’t die unless you drop the torch or it burns out.
  - Silver bird cage slays whatever is placed behind its bars, slowly, over one long night- That which is killed reanimates twice as strong, as a raging uncontrollable undead.
  - Black Crown of the Crippled King- Wearing this crooks your body as you become aware that you and every creature within 100 yards gain +10 to your rolls but your maximum HP is halved- Rolls modified to go above 20 count as  crits- The worn crown can only be removed in the pale light of a full moon.
  - Anyone wearing this ancient blindfold becomes invisible to those who breathe though the undead attack them obsessively and nearby corpses awaken in moaning, unholy wrath.
