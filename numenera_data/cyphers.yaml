Eye OF Mind Speaking:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small metallic disk
  Effect: When applied to a creature's head, the disk immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. After five minutes, an eyelike milky orb opens in the center of the disk. For the next 28 hours, the wearer gains a sixth sense, allowing them to see all creatures with minds limned in a glowing aura within long range. This allows the wearer to gauge the creature's relative mental strength (its level) and see its silhouette even in otherwise lightless conditions, or if the wearer's line of sight is blocked. The wearer can attempt mental communication with a creature they can sense, but the target can refuse contact.
Helpful Thread:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: Injects a tiny, wormlike thread that visibly travels just beneath the user's skin. For the next 28 hours, the helpful thread can communicate telepathically with the user. The helpful thread remembers everything that happens to the user, can have limited conversations regarding the user and its experiences, and generally makes an ideal sounding board for the user. The helpful thread provides an asset to Intellect tasks.
Biting Glove:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Three-fingered biomechanical glove
  Effect: When first worn, the cypher inflicts 1 point of damage as the glove constricts and makes a connection. For the next 28 hours, while the glove remains active and worn, any task requiring the wearer to hold or manipulate an object is hindered. During the same period, the user can extend short, synthsteel, needlelike teeth from the glove as part of another action. While the teeth are extended, the wearer's unarmed melee attacks inflict additional damage equal to the cypher level.
Penumbra Glove :
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Six-fingered black metal gauntlet
  Effect: When first worn, the cypher inflicts 1 point of damage as the glove constricts and makes a connection. For the next 28 hours while the glove remains active and worn, the wearer can extend a light-eating shadow to cover a weapon they wield as part of another action. The shadow dissipates if the wearer stops holding or carrying the weapon. While the shadow cover persists, the weapon inflicts additional cold damage equal to the cypher level.
Skin Of phasing:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Thin wrap of glistening material   that lays itself across large sections of wearer's natural skin
  Effect: Once activated, the wearer gains control of their phase state for 28 hours. The wearer can slowly pass through physical barriers at a rate of 1 inch per round (minimum of one round to pass through any barrier). They can't act on or perceive anything until they pass entirely through the barrier. Force fields repel movement, returning the wearer to the point of entry. Alternatively, the wearer can change their phase when they make a Speed defense roll, easing it. Each time they do so, the remaining duration of the cypher drops by one hour.
Sun Shroud:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Cloak of translucent fabric
  Effect: When activated, the wearer's body is shrouded in flames for up to one hour. The fire doesn't burn the wearer, but it automatically inflicts fire damage equal to its cypher level to anyone who tries to touch or strike the wearer. While the shroud is active, the wearer also gains +2 Armor that protects only against fire damage from another source.
Mask Of machine Speaking:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Mask
  Effect: Once activated, this mask covers the wearer's face, neck, arms, and hands with a silvery-gold tracery that pulses with threads of light. For the next 28 hours, the wearer gains an asset to all tasks related to tracking, salvaging, communicating, attacking, or defending against machines. During this period, the wearer can attempt to take command of a machine within short range that they can sense. An affected machine obeys the wearer's will for one hour, until the wearer tries to command a different machine or the machine breaks free of the control in some fashion.
Metal Melding Helm:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Head-covering helm studded with   strange devices
  Effect: Once activated, the wearer can exert force on metal objects within short range for up to one hour. The force exerted is approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable, adult human. The wearer can use it to slowly move or push off from metal objects, and so on. This force lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move quickly, so in most situations, it's not a means of attack.
Detonation (Horde Suppressor):
  Level 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Wristband projector (long range)
  Usable: Handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Explodes to release a burst of neurotoxic mist affecting all creatures within long range, hindering all attacks for about an hour. If effectively targeted during a conflict against a ranked horde or community, the affected horde or community inflicts 1 point of damage less than normal during that community action.
Effort Enhancement:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Adhesive patch that activates when slapped
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, the user can access a thin connection to the datasphere to gain a very specific effect. When applying Effort to a task related to a predetermined skill, the user can apply one free level of Effort. The skills encoded are generally restricted to the following.
  Roll:
   - 01–10 Melee attacks
   - 11–20 Ranged attacks
   - 21–40 Understanding numenera
   - 41–50 Salvaging numenera

   - 76–80 Speed defense
   - 81–85 Intellect defense
   - 86–90 Swimming
   - 91–95 Riding
   - 96–00 Sneaking
Acidic Resonator:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky handheld device
  Effect: When activated, any exposed metallic weapons within short range bead with acid for about an hour, granting affected weapons 1 additional point of damage when used in combat. If the use is coordinated with attackers who make up a community's or horde's combat force, the community or horde inflicts +1 damage during the next community-scale combat interaction.
Community Beacon:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: When activated, the cypher splits into two pieces. One piece is affixed to a numenera structure, and the other is kept by a character. The character can then use the connection between the two pieces to trigger a spatial warp any time within the next 28 hours. The spatial warp returns the user and all targets within immediate range to a location next to the numenera structure, no matter how far apart the character and the structure were.
Crafter's Eyes:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Thick lenses on frames worn over eyes
  Effect: Informative images formed on the inner lenses allow the user to automatically succeed on any one crafting subtask whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's level.

  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Badge
  Effect: User cannot knowingly tell a lie for one hour.
Destiny Nodule:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to tool
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the tool the nodule is attached to is used to repair, craft, or modify an object or structure, the tool provides the user an additional asset to the task.
Health Resonator:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky handheld device
  Effect: When activated, creatures within short range each gain 2 points of health (or 2 points to Might for PCs) for about an hour. If the use is coordinated with attackers who make up a community's or horde's combat force, the force has +2 health during that community action.
Hiding Alarm Nodule:
  Level: 7
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to installation
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the installation to which the nodule is attached is struck hard enough to inflict damage (but not more than once per round), the structure or installation goes out of phase for one hour. The installation must fit in a cube up to a short distance wide, tall, and deep. All contents of the out-of-phase structure also go out of phase, unless they somehow leave the structure.
Immobilizer:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: The user directs one end of the cypher at a target within short range, which is then subject to an attack by a projected mass of rapidly expanding and hardening foam. The target is held immobile in the hardened mass of foam for one hour, after which the mass turns to powder.
Infrastructure Drill:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Large sphere with a thick screw protrusion
  Effect: The user attaches this cypher to a wall or other structure. On the following round, it drills into the object and keeps going beneath the surface for the next hour, creating a series of tunnels that weaken the integrity of the structure and connecting structures. This decreases the level of all commonplace structures connected to the initial structure within long range and inflicts 3 points of damage to a ranked community's infrastructure.
Installation Enhancer:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Bulky device and several metal plates
  Effect: When securely attached to an installation, it increases the level of the entire installation up to the level of the cypher for about one hour (no effect on installations of a level equal to or higher than the cypher).
Emotion Smoother:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Adhesive patch that activates when slapped
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: For the next hour, the character loses access to the part of their mind that registers and produces emotion. This allows the user to experience situations they might not otherwise be able to handle, to fairly weigh options without emotional shortcuts, or to tell completely convincing lies because they are no longer generating micro-expressions or other telling responses due to emotional inconsistency.
Farspeaker:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: For the next ten minutes, the user can be heard at any distant location that they can see, as long as nothing physically blocks the intervening space. They can also hear sounds made in return. The area in which the user can speak and hear is up to a short distance across in the target location.
Gravity Changer:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Useable: Metal plates
  Effect: Once placed, the plates change the direction of gravity within an area up to a short distance in diameter. The gravitic warp could be continuous across the affected area, or it could bend and curve, changing directions within the area up to a number of times equal to the level of the cypher. Once gravity is warped, it cannot be changed and persists for 28 hours.
Harmony Lamp:
  Level: 1d6
  Useable: Crystal orb, nodule, disc
  Effect: For an hour after activation, the cypher emits a combination of colored light, sound, odor, and healing nanobots that permeate an area up to a short distance across. All positive interaction tasks made in the area gain an asset. Creatures who've made up their minds about a topic may be open to revisiting the issue. PCs add +1 to recovery rolls made in the area. The additional iotum must be of the same kind that has already been discovered, and the iotum must be of a level equal to or less than the level of this cypher.
Iotum Upgrader:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky handheld device
  Effect: When attached to 1 unit of iotum, that iotum can then be used as if it were a unit of iotum 1 level higher in a crafting task. For example, an upgraded unit of io (level 1)could be used as if it were a unit of responsive synth (level 2) for the purpose of one crafting task, or a unit of quantium (level 5) could be used as if it were a unit of protomatter (level 6).
Iron Wind Resistance:
  Level: 7
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: Grants the user two assets to defense tasks made to resist the effects of an instance of the iron wind (and attempts to resist any ongoing effects instigated by previous iron wind contact, if any) for the next 28 hours.
Mechanical Wright:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Complex device
  Effect: Crafts one numenera object or structure whose level can be no higher than the mechanical wright's level minus 3 (minimum level 1), as long as a numenera plan is provided to work from. Crafting occurs over the course of the next 28 hours, regardless of the target device's level. Components, including parts and iotum, are contributed from the mechanical wright, which becomes completely integrated into the new numenera device over the course of the crafting process.
Installation Mover:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Bulky device and several metal plates
  Effect: When securely attached to an installation, it allows the entire installation to be moved to another location within very long range (which is normally a difficult task). The transfer requires that the user be able to push the installation to the new location, but for the duration of about an hour, the installation seems almost weightless. During the transfer, the installation does not function.
Instant Item:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Bulky amulet
  Effect: This cypher has a two-stage activation. The first stage occurs when the wearer keys an object that they can hold in one hand to the cypher. The object falls into a subspace pocket and remains indefinitely or until a user activates the cypher a second (and final) time, immediately retrieving the stored item.
Instant Wall:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: With the addition of water and air, the small device expands into an immobile plane up to 10 feet (3 m) tall, 30 feet (9 m) long, and 2 feet (60 cm) thick. It is made from a form of shapestone and is permanent and immobile once created.
Instant Workshop:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: This small device expands into a workbench that fixes itself in place. The workbench provides an adjustable-height work surface with light and a variety of attached tools suitable for working with commonplace objects, numenera objects, and structural components. The workshop enables crafting tasks by providing the appropriate tools and workspace, though it does not provide shelter from the elements. The workbench and all its components are made from a form of shapemetal, and the workbench is permanent and immobile once created.
Iotum Stabilizer:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Bulky handheld device
  Effect: When used as part of a salvaging task, the field emitted by the cypher stabilizes all iotum within short range so that an additional 1d6 units of iotum are recovered.
Phasing Gloves:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Gloves
  Effect: These gloves can selectively phase through solid objects whose level is no higher than the cypher level in a fashion that allows the wearer to see what they are touching, providing an asset for anyone attempting to repair a disabled object or structure. Someone wearing the gloves could also search behind walls and under floors using the gloves. The gloves retain their phasing ability for up to one minute per cypher level. If used as part of a salvagingtask, the gloves grant two assets.
Psychic Defense Nodule:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to side of head
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the wearer of the nodule is affected by an attack that attempts to sway their actions or beliefs or that inflicts Intellect damage, they instead go into stasis for one round and remain unaffected. While in stasis, they also lose their next turn. Attacks against a wearer in stasis are made as if the wearer were protected by a force field whose level is equal to the cypher's level.
Rage Thrower:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to large tanks and a wide hose
  Effect: When activated, creatures within short range are coated with a fine mist of insinuating nano particles that enter their blood and stimulate their behavior for about an hour, making them more violent but less able to feel pain. This grants them +1 Armor but an inability to use Effort from their Intellect Pool. If the use is coordinated with attackers who make up a community's or horde's combat force, the force is treated as a marauding hordeduring that community action.
Retriever :
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Glove of synth and small nodule
  Usable: Small handheld device and small nodule
  Effect: "These cyphers always come in at least two parts: a nodule and some kind of retrieving device. The nodule can be attached to an item your size or smaller. When the cypher is activated, that item is teleported to the device."
Object Replicator:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to object that weighs up to 10 pounds (5 kg)
  Effect: "Replicates three additional copies of most objects whose level is equal to or less than this cypher's level. A unit of iotum can be replicated, but not functioning cyphers, artifacts, or similar devices."
Organ Factory:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: "Over the course of 28 hours, the user grows an external, fully viable living organ or limb. This is a somewhat painful process that dazes the user for the last half of the process. The completely grown organ or limb can be transferred to another creature simply by placing it on their body and waiting a few rounds. If the recipient creature has sustained damage to the same kind of organ or limb, the newly grown one replaces it over the course of about a minute (during which time the recipient creature is stunned). Otherwise, the duplicate organ or limb withers and dies. Duplicate organs must be used within one week. All force-grown organs and limbs are sealed within a partially living, protective, translucent caul. The cypher can produce one of the following, chosen by the user at the time of the cypher's use:"
  Roll:
   - 01–04 Heart 36–45 Foot
   - 05–08 Lung 46–55 Full arm
   - 09–12 Brain 56–65 Full leg

Summoning Alarm Nodule:
  Level: 6
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to installation
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the structure or installation to which the nodule is attached is struck hard enough to inflict damage (but not more than once per round), whoever attached the nodule is teleported from any location within very long range to a location standing next to the installation.
Sustenance Implant:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: For the next number of days equal to the cypher level, the wearer feels no ill effects from not eating or from overeating. They also gain an asset to any defense tasks to withstand poison.
Trail Blazer:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Single boot with attached device
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the boot touches down on solid ground, it deposits a patch of nanites that mark the area with a symbol. At any time before the duration expires, the wearer (and up to one other person that can be carried along) can use an action to instantly teleport back to any of these symbols. The teleportation effect brings the cypher's duration to an end.
Transdimensional Sense:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: The user can see out-of-phase, invisible, and transdimensional creatures, objects, and sources of energy within long range for 28 hours. If ingested by a creature who attempts to salvage a particular kind of iotum during a salvage task, the effects of this cypher grant the user one free level of Effort if they first use a level of Effort on that task.
Travel Bubble:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Useable: Handheld device
  Effect: The user and any additional targets that can fit into a space an immediate distance in diameter are encapsulated in a spherical force field for up to ten hours or until the user collapses it. The sphere hovers at all times and moves as the user wishes vertically or horizontally up to a short distance each round. If the sphere is destroyed or collapsed, whatever it contains falls to the ground.
Salvage Graft:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Small metallic disc
  Effect: When applied to a creature's head, the disk immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. Within five minutes, the creature is trained in tasks related to salvaging numenera. If the creature is already trained or specialized in salvaging numenera, this graft has no effect. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear, but the disc remains.
Shapemetal:
  Level: 6
  Usable: Canister containing a silvery, shapeable clay
  Effect: This metallic clay can be shaped and greatly expanded to create individual tools or objects such as a hammer, a ladder, or a basic structure such as a wall, bench, floor, staircase, and so on, as long as the total volume created could fit in a 10-foot (3 m) cube. Once formed, the structure or objects are permanent.
Slash-Retardant Spray:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to large tanks and a wide hose
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, walls and structures sprayed with these repairing nanites are treated as if 1 level higher.

Stealth Thrower:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to large tanks and a wide hose
  Effect: When activated, creatures within short range are coated with a fine mist of dull nano particles that render them more difficult to pick out from their surroundings for about an hour, granting them an asset to stealth tasks. If the use is coordinated with attackers who make up a community's or horde's combat force, the force is treated as a stealthy horde during that community action.
Blinking Nodule:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to armor
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time (but not more than once per round) the wearer of the armor the nodule is attached to is struck hard enough to inflict damage, they teleport an immediate distance in a random direction (not up or down). Since the wearer is prepared for this effect and their foe is not, the wearer's defenses are eased for one round after they teleport (eased by two steps if the cypher is level 5 or higher).

  Usable: Nodule that affixes to a melee weapo
  Effect: When the cypher is attached to a weapon, the weapon gains limited intelligence, a semblance of a personality, and the ability to speak for 28 hours. During this period, attacks the wielder makes with the weapon are eased as long as the user maintains a good relationship with the temporary intelligence invested in the weapon. If the user has the ability to gain a follower, they could choose the newly imbued weapon to be that follower. If so, it retains its intelligence indefinitely as a level 3 automaton that provides two additional knowledge-based modifications (in addition to its ability to provide an asset to attacks using itself).
Beast Lure :
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky device that must be set on the ground as part of its activation
  Effect: The nearest “savage beast” whose level is up to 1 less than the cypher's level (such as a ravage bear or broken hound) within 3 miles (5 km) is lured by the cypher, makes its way to the cypher's location, and calmly remains there for up to one hour.

City Shroud:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Bulky handheld devic
  Effect: When activated, the cypher splits into two pieces. If either piece is moved to a location up to 1 mile (1.5 km) away from the other and activated, the area between them becomes the outermost diameter of a sphere of visual distortion. It hides any artificial structures within from anyone viewing the location from outside the area. The effect lasts for 28 hours. Outside viewers see only a continuation of the natural landscape around the affected area. The cypher can be used to hide a small community, ruins, or some other site, assuming it fits within an area no more than 1 mile across.
Clean Bright:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld projector
  Effect: Over the course of the next hour, scrubbing nanobots move across (and into) a nearby structure of up to 5,000 square feet (465 square m). The structure is cleaned and tidied as if subject to the expert attention of a reliable cleaning service.
Cognitive Defender:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Badge
  Effect: The user gains +3 Armor against effects that would inflict Intellect damage for 28 hours. During this same period, negative mental feelings related to anxiety, depression, inability to cope with frustrating experiences, feelings of incapacitating rage, and similar feelings are mollified. If any such effects are hindering the character's actions, they are alleviated during this period as well.the other cypher piece endpoint, creating a stable road-like surface between them. The strip swerves around objects, terrain features, and structures, but it bridges ravines and other gaps in the landscape that are less than 300 feet (90 m) wide. The strip becomes a permanent fixture of the landscape.
Calm Center:
  Level: 1d6

Chiurgeon Orb:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Metallic orb
  Effect: When activated, the chiurgeon orb tumbles away in the direction the user throws it as if unaffected by gravity, moving at a rate of an immediate distance each round for about a minute. The orb's surface becomes suffused with healing nanobots, and as it passes within 30 feet (6 m) of living creatures, they regain points to their Pools (or health) equal to the cypher's level if they are hurt. The moving orb bounces off fixed surfaces, and thus might be set to bounce back and forth across a field of conflict for the duration of the effect. When a minute has passed, the orb tumbles to the ground, inert.If used during a conflict between ranked communities or hordes, the affected force regains health equal to one third the cypher's level (minimum 1) for that community action.CYPHERS
Deception Bud:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small sphere of flesh and metal
  Effect: When applied to a creature's head, the sphere immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain.

  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Wristband projector (long range)
  Usable: Handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: The cypher explodes and releases a massive burst of afferent particles that affect all living creatures within very long range, preventing creatures of up to level 4 from initiating attacks (though they can defend themselves). Each time an affected creature is attacked, it gains another opportunity to try to free itself from the effect. If used during a conflict with a ranked community or horde, the conflict is stalled during that community action (unless extreme actions are taken to shake the combatants out of their peaceful trance).
Detonation (Tracer):
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Wristband projector (long range) and associated handheld device
  Usable: Handheld projector (long range) and associated handheld device

Colossal Form:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Injection
  Effect: Nanobot infusion slowly increases the user's mass over the course of one hour. At the end of the hour, the user has reached a height of 30 feet (9 m), which lasts for about an hour. While colossal, the character adds 15 points to their Might Pool, adds 2 to their Might Edge, gains +1 to Armor, and deals 4 additional points of damage with melee attacks. However, their Speed defense tasks are hindered by three steps. If used as part of a conflict involving a ranked horde or community, treat the user as a rampaging beast with a rank of 2 during that community action.
Corpse Likeness:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Metallic orb
  Effect: This cypher has a two-part activation. First, it must be placed on a humanoid corpse that has not decayed for more than a few days. After one minute, the cypher takes on a red glow, indicating that it's ready. Whoever next picks up the orb takes on the likeness of the corpse, a likeness that persists for about 28 hours. In casual settings, the user can pass as whoever the corpse was before they died, and the user gains two assets to passing themselves off as the corpse if they come under active scrutiny.
Death Protector:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Harness-like overwear
  Effect: If the wearer is debilitated or killed, the wearer's body (assuming it remains mostly intact) is flushed with emergency nanobots that take control of the body so that it takes discrete steps to protect and repair itself. During the next minute, even if the user is dead, the body moves away from danger by the safest available route. At the end of this duration, the user makes a one-action recovery roll (again, even if dead; this returns the user to life). The roll does not count against the limit on recovery rolls that a character can make in a day. If the creature is already trained or specialized in such tasks, this graft has no effect. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear, but the disc remains.A creature with an exploration graft who attempts the long-term task Discover New Area of Interest accomplishes that task in half the normal time.
Extroversion Revealer:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid

  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small sphere of flesh and metal
  Effect: When applied to a creature's head, the sphere immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. For the next 28 hours, the bud whispers helpful advice that grants two assets to any tasks related to persuasion, gaining insight into another creature's true thoughts and feelings, detecting falsehoods, and inspiring others. The bud dries up and falls off after it has provided its benefit, leaving only a tiny blemish.
Infrastructure Mender:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Metallic square with silvery tendrils
  Effect: The user attaches this cypher to a wall or other structure. On the following round, it extends its exposed tendrils into the object, and the tendrils spread beneath its surface and into any adjoining inert objects and structures, strengthening their integrity, a process that takes about an hour. Once complete, the effect adds 1 level to all commonplace structures connected to the initial structure within long range and repairs 3 points of damage to the infrastructure of a ranked community. (If a ranked community's infrastructure isn't damaged, it gains 3 points of infrastructure.)
Instant Bioreactor:
  Level: 1d6 + 4

  Effect: When activated, the null orb tumbles away in the direction the user throws it as if unaffected by gravity, moving at a rate of an immediate distance each round for about a minute. The orb's surface becomes charged with entropic energy, and as it passes within 30 feet (6 m) of living creatures, damage equal to the cypher's level is inflicted on them. The moving orb bounces off fixed surfaces, and thus might be set to bounce back and forth across a field of conflict for the duration of the effect. When a minute has passed, the orb tumbles to the ground, inert.If used during a conflict between ranked communities or hordes, the affected force suffers damage equal to one third the cypher's level (minimum 1).

  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Cylindrical device with red sphere on top
  Effect: The cypher broadcasts a deleterious psychic influence to creatures within immediate range that propagates outward to other nearby creatures, affecting each in turn in a spreading ripple that can reach up to a very long distance, assuming there are enough creatures to propagate the effect. An affected creature loses its will to fight and may bolt and run. The effect lasts for about a minute. If used as part of a conflict against a ranked community or horde, a community's combat force or horde whose rank is equal to or less than half the cypher's level leaves the field during that community action
Road Builder:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Bulky handheld device
  Effect: When activated, the cypher splits into two pieces. If either piece is moved to a location up to 10 miles (16 km) away and activated, a wave of nanobots sweeps out from the activated piece, moving at a rate of 1 mile (1.5 km) per hour. In the wave's wake is left a strip of solid grey stonelike material 10 feet (3 m) wide and 1 foot (30 cm) thick. Eventually the wave and the strip behind it connects to the other cypher piece endpoint, creating a stable road-like surface between them. Tunnels with a navigable space 30 feet (9 m) high are created through natural and artificial barriers, and bridge-like struts are extended to support the strip over ravines and other gaps. The strip swerves around objects and structures of level 4 and higher. The strip becomes a permanent fixture of the landscape.
Rodule of Branding:
  Level: 1d6
  Useable: Rod 1 foot (30 cm) long
  Effect: The user permanently marks the forehead (or other specified location that the user is able to touch) of a target with a simple symbol, glyph, or two or three words of the user's choice. The brand could be punitive, could mark the target as a member of some society or group, or could be merely decorative.
Rodule of Inquisition:
  Level: 1d6
  Useable: Rod 1 foot (30 cm) long
  Effect: The user rapidly gains complete knowledge of an object or creature touched with the rodule if its level is equal to or less than the cypher's level. Information includes the target's special qualities, special abilities, weaknesses (if any), level, and so on. If the object is an artifact or a complex piece of equipment whose level is no higher than the rodule's level + 4, the user understands how to use it.
Quantium Boost:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Device filled with glittering points of light with attached handle and control
  Effect: The cypher moves the user forward in time about a minute. For the user, no time passes, but for everyone else, the user is simply gone for about a minute.
Rally Beacon:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Bulky backpack-like device with a mast rising about a foot (30 cm)
  Effect: The cypher grants all creatures within short range at the time of activation +1 to Speed Effort and +1 Armor for one hour. If used as part of a conflict against a ranked community or horde, the affected combat force has +1 Armor during that community action.
Rampaging Form :
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Injection
  Effect: A nanobot infusion turns the user into an uncontrolled beast for one hour. While changed, they attack any and every living creature within short range. In addition, they gain +3 Armor, 10 points to their Might Pool, 3 to their Might Edge, 10 points to their Speed Pool, and 3 to their Speed Edge. While in beast form, they can't spend Intellect points for any reason other than to try to change back to their normal form before the duration ends (a task with a difficulty equal to the cypher's level). If used as part of a conflict involving a ranked horde or community, treat the user as a rampaging beast with a rank of 3 during that community actionCYPHERS
Sustenance Graft:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Small metallic disc
  Effect: When applied to a creature's head, the disc immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. Within five minutes, the creature is trained in tasks related to living off the land, including finding sources of food and water. If the creature is already trained or specialized in such tasks, the graft has no effect. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear, but the disc remains.A creature with a sustenance graft who attempts the long-term task Build Up Food or Water Stores accomplishes that task in half the normal time.
Salvage Assistant:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky handheld device
  Effect: When used as part of a salvage attempt to find shins, cyphers, artifacts, and iotum, this device grants two advantages. First, it provides an asset to the initial salvage task. If salvage is discovered, either it grants an asset to the user's attempt to find a specific kind of iotum, or it gives the user one additional roll on the Random Salvage Result table.
Stealth Coating:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: The cypher disperses stealth particles over the surface of an object (or several objects) that can fit in an area 10 feet (3 m) on a side. The object is no longer visible to casual observation, and tasks specifically made to find or perceive the treated object(s) are hindered by two steps. The effect lasts until the objects are moved or damaged.
Structural Reinforcer:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Bulky backpack-like device with a connected tube
  Effect: When sprayed on a structure in immediate range, skin-like material reinforces the structure up to a short distance on a side, increasing its level by 1 per cypher level. Additional uses of this type of cypher on the structure provide no additional benefit.
Camouflage Screen:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: This device projects an opaque, two-dimensional screen of light that is 12 feet (3.6 m) high and 20 feet (6 m) across. It lasts up to 28 hours. The screen bears an animate image appropriate to the surrounding area (trees and brush in a forest, sandy dunes in a desert, etc.). Thus, anything behind the screen is easily hidden from visual observation unless the viewer is within immediate distance (and even then it may be obscured, depending on the circumstances).
Clamp Trap:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Metal, mouth-like clamp
  Effect: When activated, this device becomes a pressure-plate trap that clamps around anything that triggers it. The device is similar to a bear trap, except that when it is fully activated, it becomes invisible. It inflicts damage equal to the cypher level, and then 1 additional point per minute until it is removed.
Deactivator:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Ring or bracelet
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: The user can deactivate one device within short range.
Detonation (Coma):
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range) or handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Explodes in a patterned flash of pale, yellow gas in an immediate radius. Living creatures in the area fall unconscious for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level, until violently slapped awake or damaged.
Detonation (Suggestion):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range) or handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Explodes in a patterned flash of multicolored lights and gas in an immediate radius. For all sentient creatures in the area of effect, the difficulty of Intellect defense rolls to resist reasonably worded suggestions is increased by a number of steps equal to half the cypher level (round down). The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.
Disintegration Gel:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Synth tube containing gel
  Effect: "When applied to a specific substance, this tube produces a fist-sized amount of gel that vaporizes the material at a rate of about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of material per round. The gel works for two rounds per cypher level. It has no effect on other materials. Roll for the material affected:"
  Roll:
   - 01–35 Metal
   - 36–39 A specific metal (GM's choice)
   - 40–71 Stone
   - 72–81 Metal or stone
   - 82–98 Synth
   - 99–00 Organic matter (inflicts cypher level in damage to a living creature)
Distance Activator :
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Handheld device with a small, detachable nodule
  Effect: When the nodule of this device is detached and connected to any other cypher, the user of the distance activator can activate that cypher from a range of up to 1 mile (1.6 km).
Duplicator (Occultic):
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Form: A synth cylinder with fine, glowing lines etched across it
  Effect: After one end is touched against a creature, a mass of gelatin sprays out the other end. Within three rounds, it creates what appears to be an exact, living copy of the touched creature, including clothing and equipment. But it's a spongy façade. The copy is a level 1 creature with minimal intelligence that lasts for up to 28 hours, when it melts and evaporates away. Before that time, the copy follows simple commands, but complex thought and emotions are beyond its capabilities.
Ejection Nodule:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon
  Effect: For the next hour, each time the weapon the nodule is attached to strikes a solid creature or object hard enough to inflict damage (but no more than once per round), the target of the strike teleports to a random location within a radius of 100 × the cypher level in feet.
Extra Time:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Belt or ring
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: The user gains up to three extra rounds. After using his action to activate this device, time slows down, and he can take up to three additional actions while the rest of the world seemingly stands still. He can make attacks, move, make a recovery roll, or take any other action allowed him. Actions are resolved normally. However, this process takes a toll. For every extra action he takes, the user suffers 3 points of damage.
Eye in the Sky:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: When activated, part of this device shoots 800 feet (240 m) into the air, projecting everything it sees onto a screen on the other portion of the device. The eye in the sky floats for an hour, all the while projecting what it sees.
Faraway Ear:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Earring or helmet
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: When this device is activated, the user can pinpoint any spot she can see, up to 1000 feet (300 m) distant, and hear whatever could normally be heard (as soft as a whisper) at that location for ten minutes.
Freeze Inducer:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Complex device, handheld device
  Effect: This item is cold to the touch, and may freeze to solid surfaces when not in use. The item is activated by being pressed against an object or creature weighing no more than 200 pounds (90 kg). Any liquid contained in the object freezes; a living creature is frozen for a number of points of damage equal to the cypher level.
Heat Sensor:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill or injector
  Wearable: Goggles, spectacles, contact lenses
  Usable: Handheld device with a screen
  Effect: For one hour, the user can perceive objects and creatures based on the heat they emit. This may allow him to see otherwise invisible or hidden targets, or even certain objects inside other objects if their temperatures are vastly different.
Helping Hand:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Form: A metallic, seven-fingered hand
  Effect: When activated, the hand hovers near the user for 28 hours. During that time, it acts as the user's third hand—holding objects, opening doors, turning dials, and so on. The helping hand can also make attacks as the user might, with weapons provided to it, but all such attacks are modified by two steps to the user's detriment.
Hover Disk:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: A metal disk about 2 feet (0.6 m) across
  Effect: The user can stand upon the disk, and for ten minutes it moves as desired, up to a long distance each round. In a combat situation, the user can take an action (other than moving) and still move a long distance. Because the disk is attuned to the wearer's thoughts, falling off is only possible if the user loses consciousness or is struck by a tremendous force (usually one that inflicts more than 8 points of damage in one blow).
Image Caster:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Complex device, handheld device
  Effect: Projects an ephemeral image within long range that looks real. The image looks like the user, speaks like the user, and moves as the user desires within long range for up to one hour. Physical interaction with the image shows it to be without substance.
Instant Wings:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Backpack
  Effect: When activated, silken wings pop out of this backpack, allowing the wearer to glide (if falling or leaping from a height) great distances, moving a long distance each round, and landing safely on the ground. The wings last until the wearer lands or for one hour, whichever comes first.
Magnetic Ink:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small container of ink
  Effect: When used to tattoo flesh, this ink embeds powerful magnets in the tattooed subject's flesh. The magnet is powerful enough to hold up to 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of metal. The ink can only be applied once, and there's only enough for a tattoo about 3 inches (7.5 cm) across, but once applied it is permanent.
Magnetic Winch:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Small metal box
  Effect: When activated, this metal box breaks into two halves joined by a very strong but thin metal cable, which is retractable and can be extended up to 120 feet (36 m). When a second switch is pressed, the boxes each become very strong magnets. When a third switch is pressed, the cable is retracted by a very powerful motor—powerful enough to pull 5000 pounds (2250 kg) of dead weight until the two boxes are joined again.
Mass Nodule:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to an object or creature
  Effect: If attached to an object or unresisting creature, the nodule adheres for one hour. The object or creature's weight increases by a factor of ten, rendering most creatures unable to move, and most objects unmovable by creatures whose level (or characters whose tier) are less than the cypher level.
Mental Coupling:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Headband or glove
  Usable: 2-foot-long (0.6 m) synth cable
  Effect: Allows one thinking creature to speak telepathically with another, touched creature. Although the connection lasts for only one minute, vast amounts of data can be exchanged if both creatures are willing.
Message Capsule:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A synth cylinder a foot (0.3 m) in length
  Effect: Upon activation, a message of up to a minute in length can be recited to the cylinder. When the message is complete, and the user provides a detailed description, signifying title, and/or name of the intended recipient, the cylinder fades from view. Within the next 100 hours, the cylinder appears to whomever the message was addressed, broadcasts the message, then crumbles into dust.
Message Detonation:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A synth cylinder a foot (0.3 m) in length
  Effect: "It takes an action to encode the capsule with a detailed description, signifying title, and/or name of the intended recipient. Once addressed, the cylinder fades from view. Within the next 100 hours, the cylinder appears to whomever it was addressed and explodes as a detonation in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher level. Roll for the type of damage:"
  Roll:
   - 01–10 Cell-disrupting (harms only flesh)
   - 11–30 Corrosive
   - 31–40 Electrical discharge
   - 41–50 Heat drain (cold)
   - 51–75 Fire
   - 76–00 Shrapnel
Mind Control Implant:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Internal: Pill
  Wearable: Disk that adheres to forehead, temporary tattoo
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: This cypher consists of two devices—an injection or pill, and a control disk or temporary tattoo. They are usually found together. For ten minutes, the disk or tattoo enables long-range mental communication with—and control of—anyone who took the injection or pill. The controller can bid the target creature to do anything it could do normally.
Mind Sled (Occultic):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: The user falls unconscious, and a round later, a luminous crystal bloodlessly emerges from her head (the crystal is not considered a cypher). When the crystal is touched by another creature, the consciousness of the user wakes in the body of that creature (and the new creature's consciousness is temporarily submerged). For all intents and purposes, the user isthe new creature in all ways except personality. The user transfers back into her own body 28 hours later. (If the user's body died in the meantime, there's a chance her consciousness will remain in the host body, but most often, the user's personality merely burns out.)
Mood Patch:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Adhesive patch that activates when slapped
  Effect: "The patch transfers a substance that makes the wearer feel an emotion, enter a particular state of mind, or forget something unpleasant. Roll percentile:"
  Roll:
   - 01–25 Moods ranging from tranquil to ecstatic for one hour
   - 26–50 Moods ranging from melancholy to suicidal for one hour
   - 51–75 Completely truthful (01–03 on d6) or pathological liar (04–06 on d6) for one hour
   - 76–00 Erases one memory chosen by wearer, permanent
Motion Activator:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Small synth nodule
  Effect: When attached to another cypher or an artifact, the motion activator activates the device if anything larger than a small dog moves within immediate range. Once activated, it cannot be deactivated.
Muscle Cart:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Small metal box with wheels
  Effect: When activated, this small cart vastly increases its mass and then begins to move forward. It can pull up to 10,000 pounds (4500 kg) for one hour, moving about 10 feet (3 m) per round regardless of terrain (within reason), but only in its original direction.
Nectar Dispenser:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small canister
  Effect: This device produces a delicious, thick liquid that provides nutrition and sustains up to three people for one day (or one person for three days) if there is a container to hold the nectar.
Needle Sphere:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Metal and synth sphere
  Effect: Upon activation, the sphere floats in the air next to the user for one round per cypher level. Each round, it fires a large needle (dart) that inflicts 3 points of damage at a target designated by the user within long range. (This occurs on the user's action, but in addition to her normal actions.) The player makes the attack rolls, and although she cannot use Effort or skill to modify her rolls, the difficulty of the attack is decreased by two steps.
Nevermind :
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: Pill, ingestible or injectable liquid
  Wearable: Earring, ring, circlet
  Effect: The wearer's mind can't be telepathically sensed or contacted for 28 hours. If the wearer has telepathic abilities or psychic attacks, they're inaccessible. On the other hand, during this period defense rolls against all kinds of psychic and mental attacks are modified by two steps to the wearer's benefit.
Orbital Launcher:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Glove of synth
  Usable: Small handheld device
  Effect: One unanchored item weighing 50 pounds (23 kg) or less within immediate range is launched upward at a chosen angle with a steady, sustained velocity that sends the object into the void over the course of several hours. If the cypher is used underground or directed to launch the item toward some sort of barrier, the cypher doesn't activate.
Overwatch Defender:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Sphere on a tripod
  Effect: Once activated, this device functions for 28 hours. If a creature with hostile intent comes within long range of this device, it immediately puts a force field around itself (and anything nearby) that encapsulates an immediate radius. This force field has 100 health; anyone wishing to get in or out of the field must batter their way through. It lasts until destroyed or for one hour, whichever comes first. Once the force field is down, the device is no longer active.
Overwatch Slayer:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Sphere on a tripod
  Effect: Once activated, this device functions for 28 hours. If a creature with hostile intent comes within long range of this device, it immediately fires a blast of energy that inflicts damage equal to the cypher level. It continues to fire, once per round, for a number of rounds equivalent to the cypher level. Once it is done firing, the device is no longer active.
Permanent Handle:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handle-shaped metal and synth piece
  Effect: When activated, this device permanently bonds (on a molecular level) to whatever it touches, giving that object a handle. It inflicts cypher level in damage to any living creature it bonds to.
Power Siphon:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Transfers power from one device to another. This device can drain power from one cypher to power another used (but still intact) cypher, or from one artifact to recharge another, depleted artifact.
Psychic Focus:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill or injection
  Wearable: Headband or crystal placed on temple or forehead
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Increases the intensity of the user's next mental ability, such as a mental Onslaught esotery or the use of psychokinesis. Damaging attacks inflict +2 damage, and other abilities have double the normal range or duration (user's choice).
Ranged Protector :
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Two rings, circlets, bracelets, or belts
  Effect: This cypher comes as a pair of items, but one is the master of the other. When the master item is activated, the creature wearing the other item is surrounded by a force shield that provides a bonus to Armor equal to the cypher level for ten minutes. While one character could wear both items, many use ranged protectors to put a shield around a pet, a child, or a defenseless charge who cannot normally activate a cypher. The master item can be activated from any range to surround its counterpart with the protective shield.
Ranged Retaliator :
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Two rings, circlets, bracelets, or belts
  Effect: This cypher comes as a pair of items, but one is the master of the other. When the master item is activated, the other item pulses with electricity that inflicts damage equal to the cypher level. The master item can be activated from any range to damage the wearer of the other.
Reanimator:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Internal: Injectable liquid
  Wearable: Disk with a strap to be fastened to the head
  Usable: Metal bolt injected into the head
  Effect: "If a mammal or reptile creature has not been dead for more than 28 hours, this device restores a basic semblance of life by reactivating their nervous system. The creature does not have the knowledge, skills, personality, or memories of its former self—it's just a mindless shell that can perform basic motor functions: walk, run, or otherwise move; pick up and hold objects; make crude attacks. It obeys the verbal commands of the user. The creature operates for one hour before collapsing. Although the GM makes the final call, small creatures are typically level 1, and others are level 2."
Snake Eye:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A synth cable 50 feet (15 m) long
  Effect: The eye-like sensor on one end of this cable allows anyone holding the other end to see what it sees. Lasts for one hour.
Solid Light Gloves:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Ring or bracelet
  Effect: User's hands are sheathed in gloves made of solid light for one hour. The user can touch or handle dangerous substances as though he had 12 Armor. This protection does not apply to combat situations.
Stealthy Serpent:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Metal disk that is actually a tightly coiled strand
  Effect: When activated, this cypher uncoils in the form of a small, metal serpent, about 2 feet (0.6 m) long. It remains animate for one round per cypher level. It can be given a single command that must be something it can accomplish within its allotted time. Once the command is carried out, it deactivates, even if it does so before its time is up. It is a level 2 creature, but it moves with stealth as level 5. It can bite once for 2 points of damage and inject a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignoring Armor) if the victim fails a Might defense roll.
Still Field:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Vest, belt, bracelet, or jumpsuit
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: For 28 hours, the user does not register on any device that senses or tracks movement or uses sonar or similar means. A creature that relies on sonar or similar methods of sensing cannot perceive the user.
Targeting Oculus:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Mask with single glass lens
  Effect: When applied to a creature's head, the mask completely envelops the head for one hour. The creature can breathe and sense normally; however, all ranged attacks the creature makes are modified by one step to the creature's benefit.
Three-Part Alarm:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: When activated, three sensor pieces detach from the main device. Each of these can be placed anywhere, as long as they are within a half mile (0.8 km) of the main device. For 28 hours, if anything larger than a small dog moves within an immediate distance of one of the sensors, the main device indicates this fact and tells the user which sensor was activated.
Vocal Changer:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill or injection
  Wearable: Choker collar
  Effect: Changes the pitch, timbre, pronunciation, and other audio characteristics of one creature to match another, or as desired. The change lasts for 28 hours.
Water Repellant Plates:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Boots or shoes
  Usable: Metal plate
  Effect: When activated, this device repels water so strongly for one hour that it can force up to 200 pounds (90 kg) of pressure away from the user. In other words, if the plates were in a pair of shoes, a character could appear to walk on water. It could also be used to allow an object to float across the surface of the water.
X-ray Extractor (Occultic):
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Glass panel with selection of dials
  Effect: When held up against a solid surface, this panel allows the user to see through up to 2 feet (0.6 m) of material. The selection of dials allows the user to discriminate between various objects within the material, permitting the visualization of buried objects, supports in walls, or organs. A successful difficulty 4 Intellect roll vaporizes a visualized discrete object, or a portion of it. An unsuccessful roll disintegrates a random chunk of material, gouging a hole in the solid surface. The device operates for one minute, and it only works if the cypher's level is higher than the material's level.
Access Glasses:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Goggles plus gloves or rings
  Effect: The user can see through up to half an inch of solid material and can pass his hands and anything his hands are holding through that solid matter. Once the area to be looked and passed through is chosen—about 18 inches by 18 inches (46 cm by 46 cm)—a new area cannot be chosen. However, the effect lasts for an hour.
Access Token:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Gloves, ring, false fingernail
  Usable: Tiny metal device
  Effect: Automatically unlocks one locked door or container within short range.
Adamant Foam:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Small spray canister
  Effect: The foam in this canister is extraordinarily light—almost weightless, lighter than a soap bubble—and virtually invisible. It's possible, in fact, to have this foam in your hand and not even realize it. And yet the foam, which dries on contact with the air, is superstrong. While pliable, it's as unbreakable as steel mesh. The canister has enough foam to coat an area 6 feet by 6 feet (2 m by 2 m) with a thin layer.Although this foam has many uses, if sprayed on a living target, that target has +2 to Armor.Adamant foam disintegrates after 28 hours.
Airfins:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Long gloves with forearm fins
  Effect: Through gravity manipulation, the wearer can swim through the air as if it were water for one hour. Training or specialization in swimming aids in movement.
Alarm Worm:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A bloated worm about 1 foot (0.3 m) long
  Effect: Six minutes after activation, the worm inflates and excretes 1d6 wet, shuddering eggs at a place the user designates. After laying the eggs, the worm slithers back to the user and coils around one of his limbs, gripping tightly. For the next seven hours, whenever a creature approaches within 5 feet (2 m) of the eggs, the worm tightens and exudes a thick orange slime that reeks of rotten meat. When the effect ends, the worm relaxes its grip, falls, and expires messily.
Amplification Parasite:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Internal: Living fish, beetle, or worm that must be ingested
  Effect: Upon eating the parasite, the user chooses one stat and the GM chooses a different stat. The difficulty of any roll related to the user's chosen stat is reduced by two steps, and the difficulty of any roll involving the GM's chosen stat is increased by two steps. The parasite dies after 1d6 hours, and the effect ends when the user violently expels it from her body.
Analysis Daemon:
  Level: 1
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Temporary tattoo, amulet, headband, crystal worn on temple
  Usable: Small handheld device, crystal
  Effect: The user examines a cypher or an artifact and then taps into the datasphere. The user automatically identifies the device.
Analysis Scanner:
  Level: 1d10
  Wearable: Bracelet
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: This device scans and records everything within short range for one round and then conveys the level and nature of all creatures, objects, and energy sources it scanned. This information can be accessed for 28 hours after the scan.
Anchor Stone:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Lump of oddly shaped stone or metal
  Effect: Submerging the device in water causes it to swell into a boulder about 5 feet (2 m) in diameter that weighs 500 pounds (227 kg).

Anxiety Engine:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: White sphere with a glowing red orb
  Effect: Fills a 5-foot (2 m) cube with a cloud of shadowy mist that lingers for one hour. The mist cannot be dispersed and remains despite the environmental conditions. Whenever a creature moves to within a short distance of the mist and can see it, the creature sees the cloud transform into something terrifying and horrific, its worst nightmares come to life. While the creature remains within a short distance of the cloud, the difficulty for all its tasks is modified by one step to its detriment.
Armor Patch:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Sewn-on patch, self-stick fabric, metallic swatch
  Effect: After being applied to armor of any kind, this patch activates when firmly slapped, sending tiny nanowires through the armor's material to provide greater benefit. 01–50 Nanowires add a repellent layer to thematerial.

Biofeedback Glove:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Single glove made of synth and nanowires
  Effect: For the next hour, each time the wearer uses the gloved hand to perform an action, the glove sends a biofeedback response regarding the action. After wearing the glove for one hour, the wearer may choose one of those actions (such as wielding a weapon, crafting, working with numenera devices, and so on). She becomes temporarily trained in that skill. For the next 28 hours, the difficulty of all tasks related to that skill is reduced by one step.
Biological Transpiercer:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Biological needle or spike that is inserted under the skin
  Effect: "Once inserted beneath the user's skin, the transpiercer releases a slow-acting biological compound that begins to mix with the user's blood, causing one of the following effects:"

   - 76–00 Causes the creature's bloodto become overly magnetized,decreasing the flow of oxygen tothe cells (does damage equal to thecypher level)
Bloom (Fireflower):
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Ceramic, glass, or other breakable material in the shape of a flower or seed pod with a fuse stem (lit and then thrown or launched, long-range)
  Effect: Ten seconds after the fuse is lit, the device explodes, sending shards of red-hot glass out into the pattern of a flower. Any living creature that comes into contact with falling or spraying shards suffers burn damage equal to the cypher level.
Bloom (Serpent):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Ceramic, glass, or other breakable material in the shape of a coiled snake with a fuse tongue (lit and then thrown or launched, long-range)
  Effect: Ten seconds after the fuse is lit, the device explodes, sending out electrified wireworms in the pattern of a long, gyrating snake. As the snake pattern slides through the air, it explodes a second time, sending the electrified wireworms out in a wider pattern. Any living creature that comes into contact with the wireworms is electrified, taking damage equal to the cypher level and becoming dazed for one round, during which time the difficulty of all tasks it performs is modified by one step to its detriment.
Bloom (Spore):
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Moss-wrapped ball filled with small pressure-activated detonator and propellant spores
  Effect: Ten seconds after the ball is firmly squeezed (to activate the detonator), the device explodes, sending spores out in foliage patterns. Any living creature that breathes in the falling or spraying spores takes damage equal to the cypher level.
Blue Crystal:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Small blue crystal
  Effect: When one gazes through a blue crystal, for a brief moment she can view a spot corresponding to her current position in a parallel universe. Moreover, the view is set a few moments in the future. However, since the crystal shows a parallel universe, the future seen may or may not be an accurate reflection of her reality. The user, then, sees a possible future. Normally, there is about a 30% chance that the glimpse is entirely accurate and a 30% chance that it is partially accurate, but these numbers depend on the circumstances.
Body Enhancer:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Tube of malleable material
  Effect: Adjusts to match the user's skin color and temperature, can be shaped into any form, and affixes itself to the user's body for up to two hours. Single action to shape and affix.
Bone Dress:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Squeezable tube filled with liquefied bone
  Effect: The material can be squeezed into a pattern of protection around anything, living or nonliving. Within a few seconds after application, the bone hardens in the established pattern, providing a cage of armor around the selected object or creature. The cage is malleable, allowing movement, and offers +1 to Armor for one hour. Application takes ten seconds or one round.
Brain Lightning:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Electrical headband
  Usable: Handheld device, long-needled syringe
  Effect: Provides a short, low-level burst of electrical stimulation directly to the brain, increasing awareness and cognitive function. As a result, the user moves one step up the damage track for ten minutes. This is a temporary effect that doesn't change the status of her Pools. If she is hale (or becomes hale), the device has no effect.
Breather Symbiote:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: A gelatinous mask that must be pressed onto the face
  Effect: Activating the symbiote causes the device to forcefully inject a long tendril down the user's throat until it reaches his lungs, where it lodges in the fleshy material. The symbiote provides him with breathable air for one hour, letting him breathe in the absence of air. However, while the symbiote is activated, the user can't speak. If the symbiote is removed, the user takes 4 points of damage.
Buoyancy:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Full bodysuit, harness worn about the chest
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: For one hour, the user cannot become submerged in any liquid.
Burrowing Bubble:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Ring, bracelet, headband
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Upon activation, for ten minutes, the user is surrounded by a bubble of energy that projects incredible heat outward, but not inward. This bubble floats 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air, inflicts 6 points of damage to all within immediate range, and inflicts 3 points of damage to all within short range. Further, it instantly melts the material directly below (of lower level than the cypher), and the bubble sinks an immediate distance into the new hole it created. This continues for the duration of the effect, so a user who stands on the ground when activating this cypher ends up about 800 feet (244 m) underground when it finally stops.If the user concentrates, she can force the bubble to move an immediate distance in any direction she chooses as an action. The user cannot penetrate the bubble, and neither can forces from the outside. Not even ambient damage gets through. Dealing at least 50 points of damage to the bubble (which has no Armor) destroys it. Damaging the bubble does not harm the user inside until the bubble is destroyed, at which point she falls from whatever height the bubble was at, which is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air.
Butterfly Drone:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Fingertip-sized winged insect built of synth and biological elements
  Effect: This voice-controlled cyberbug travels in a designated direction and distance. There, it holds its position, flying around in the area for ten minutes, recording sound and images. After that time, it returns to the user. To decipher the information, the user must ingest the bug, which then relays the recording via mechanical impulses to her brain. She sees and hears the recording only once.
Cable Projector:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Wrist-mounted projector
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Projects a cable or rope (if the PC has one) attached to a powerful spike up to long range. The projected rope embeds itself solidly into most surfaces, and the cypher can retract the rope later or pull it extremely taut. If desired, the device can easily be spiked into a surface so that the rope attaches to something solid at both ends.
Camouflage Spray:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Canister
  Effect: An inanimate object (or group of objects) small enough to fit into a cube that is 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m by 3 m) can be quickly coated so that its color and texture blend into its surroundings perfectly.
Caustic Storm:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: When activated, the cypher surrounds the user with a nimbus of energy, giving him +10 to Armor that works only against caustic damage. This lasts for one round, and the Armor is ablative, which is to say that each point of damage that it absorbs destroys 1 point of the Armor.The cypher also releases fourteen hailstone-sized motes of roiling caustic fluid that fly toward and attack all targets (including the user) within immediate range, one mote per target. If there are not fourteen targets within immediate range, the motes fly out to short range. If there are not fourteen targets within short range, they fly out to long range. If there are not fourteen targets within long range, the targets within long range get attacked twice (or more times) each, starting with those in immediate range.
Chitin Colony:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small container filled with metal shavings
  Effect: The shavings sprout sharp legs and rush out of the container to completely encase the user's body. Each piece locks with another piece to form a flexible mesh. The user gains +1 to Armor for one hour.
Cicerone:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld automaton
  Effect: The user activates the device, points the automaton's face in the general direction he wishes to go, and states a general distance. The device suggests the easiest and quickest way to travel that route, taking into account terrain, weather, potential threats, and existing paths. It functions for 28 hours and then dies, speaking a single bit of useful information about the route ahead when it does so.
Cleaner:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Wristband projector (immediate range)
  Usable: Metal container filled with what looks like metal filings
  Effect: When activated, the device dissolves the remains of one dead human-sized creature into a small pile of salts and other minerals.
Cloaking Pin:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Metal disk that has been made into a lapel pin
  Effect: When activated, this creates a cloaking field that effectively makes the user invisible and completely silent for one minute. While invisible, the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if he does something to reveal his presence or position—attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, he can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding his position.
Clone Tank:
  Level: 10
  Usable: A large glass and metal tank filled with pink slime
  Effect: To activate this device, the user must place a few drops of blood, strands of hair, nail clippings, or a piece of flesh in the slime. The slime hardens around the organic material to form a cyst. Over the next 3d6 months, the device rapidly grows a person from the material. At the end of this time, a full-grown creature, identical in every physical way to the donor creature, emerges from the tank, and the device deactivates. The clone is a level 1 creature. It can communicate in a language known to the user, but otherwise it understands nothing of the world. It becomes a unique character that develops a personality, objectives, and nature of its own.
Cloud Seed:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Handheld projector (5 miles or 8 km)
  Effect: This device can be activated only outdoors and with a clear and unobstructed path to the sky. Once activated, a bright white mote flies up from the device into the sky and explodes, throwing grey tendrils out for 1 mile (2 km) in all directions. After one minute, the tendrils become dark clouds, and after another minute, the skies open up and drench the ground below with heavy rains. In freezing temperatures, the precipitation is sleet, ice, or snow. With the rain comes lightning and thunder. The storm moves with the prevailing winds and dissipates 1d6 hours later.
Cloudskimmer:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: A lightweight box large enough to hold four human-sized creatures
  Effect: The lid of the box opens, and ten small bags rise from within and spend the next five minutes filling with a lighter-than-air gas. As they inflate, they rise above the box, revealing an empty compartment. A sturdy cord tethers each balloon to the box. When the balloons finish inflating, they lift the box and anything in it into the air at a rate of 100 feet (30 m) per minute until it reaches a maximum altitude of 1,000 feet (305 m). The device remains airborne for seven hours. After this time, it loses 100 feet (30 m) of altitude every ten minutes until it lands. The device moves in whatever direction the winds are blowing.
Colorless Grease:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: A metal container filled with thin, colorless grease
  Effect: There's enough grease in the container to cover a human-sized creature or an object that can fit inside a 5-foot (2 m) cube. Rubbing the grease onto the target causes it to reflect no color and become invisible for as long as the grease remains. The grease wears off after 1d6 hours. Heat can cause the grease to melt and run, revealing the concealed target early.
Communication Disks:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Small synth disks
  Effect: These cyphers usually come in pairs (although each is its own cypher). They allow verbal communication between their users at any distance. Both cyphers must be activated at the same time, and they function for 28 hours.
Complex Fluid Wall Projector:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Creates a wall of complex fluid up to 30 feet by 30 feet by 1 foot (9 m by 9 m by 0.3 m). It inflicts damage equal to the cypher level on any out-of-phase creature that passes through it. Breaking through or puncturing the wall is a task equal to the cypher level.The wall conforms to the space available. It lasts for one hour.
Concrete Casting:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Compound
  Effect: When mixed with water, this compound turns into malleable paste. If molded around a piece of armor, a body part, or another object and allowed to harden for ten minutes, the paste gives it an additional layer of protection, granting +3 to Armor. The paste lasts for one hour before it begins to disintegrate.
Construction Foam:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Large canister
  Effect: The canister produces a vast amount of foam. This foam can easily be shaped into whatever form the user wishes that equals about four 10-foot (3 m) cubes—the size of a small house or a wall that's 1 foot (0.3 m) thick, 10 feet (3 m) high, and 400 feet (122 m) long. This probably takes about twenty minutes. The foam dries quickly (in about a half hour) and hardens to the strength of steel, but it remains fairly lightweight. The entire mass of hardened foam weighs about 200 pounds (91 kg).
Contingent Subroutine:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid, inhalable powder
  Wearable: Temporary tattoo, dermal patch
  Effect: The device automatically activates if the user becomes debilitated or dies. The device downloads special instructions from the datasphere that cause the body to take steps to protect and repair itself. During the next minute, the user is under the GM's control and on each of the user's turns, even if he is dead, he takes an action to move away from danger by the safest available route. At the end of this time, he makes a recovery roll—again, even if he is dead. The recovery roll does not count against the limit on recovery rolls that he can make in a day.
Countermeasure (Magnetic):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: This device creates an invisible field that fills an area within short range and lasts for one minute. The field scrambles magnetic fields, making any device or power involving magnetism unusable. The effect lasts as long as the device or power remains within the field.
Countermeasure (Membrane):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: This device creates an invisible field around up to three living creatures that lasts for one minute. The field scrambles all effects of incoming technological devices, ricocheting the effect back toward the initiator. It has no effects on technological devices used inside the field.
Countermeasure (Technological):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Two rounds after being activated, the device creates an invisible field that fills an area within short range and lasts for one minute. The field scrambles the electronic processes of most technological devices and makes them inoperable. Intelligent devices cannot take actions during this time. The effect lasts as long as the devices remain within the field.
Crystal Virus:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Crystal that affixes to forehead
  Effect: When placed on a human's forehead, this cypher immediately takes effect by permanently grafting itself in place (no longer counting against the person's cypher limit). Within 1d10 + 2 days, the wearer's flesh begins to take on a crystalline appearance in patches. In three times that number of days, her entire body becomes organic crystal, flexible enough to move without hindrance, but hard and cold like crystal. She has +1 to Armor permanently but is no longer capable of sexual reproduction. Further, at the time of complete transformation, she produces a new crystal virus cypher, which can be used by another human.It's possible to remove the crystal before complete transformation, but it requires surgery and the task difficulty is equal to the cypher level. Doing so ensures that the creature's flesh returns to normal. This will not work after complete transformation occurs.
Cyberflesh:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: Pill, injection
  Wearable: Spray-on mist
  Effect: A character covered in cyberflesh has many advantages. The metallic coating offers +1 to Armor. The character also can use an action to touch any numenera device and automatically learn its function and how to use it (if possible). Cyberflesh lasts for ten minutes.
Cypher Replicator:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: An orb created from a series of synth blocks in various shapes that connect to each   other via male and female tabs
  Effect: The user can dismantle the orb and use the individual blocks to replicate the shape of a weapon, bit of armor, or piece of equipment that is in her line of sight. Even if the duplicate is not identical, the finished object gives a viewer the sense that it is. In fact, for most people, it would be hard to tell the two objects apart. Creating the duplicate takes two actions. The replicated item works exactly as the original does, except that it disintegrates in one hour.
Cypher Seed:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Tiny metal and synth chip
  Effect: If affixed to another cypher that is a handheld device, it infuses that cypher with additional circuitry like roots from a plant. In 28 hours, it transforms the cypher into an artifact. The GM determines whether the new artifact retains the same ability (but now with potentially multiple uses) or whether it becomes a different artifact of the handheld-device variety.
Data Flood:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Dermal patch that must be worn and tapped to be activated
  Effect: Activating the cypher enables the user to connect her mind to the datasphere for one hour. Until the connection is broken, the difficulty is reduced by one step for her Intellect defense rolls and Intellect tasks to identify objects, creatures, and places.
Data Merge:
  Level: 10
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Temporary tattoo, amulet, headband, crystal worn on temple
  Usable: Small handheld device, crystal
  Effect: The user uploads his mind into the datasphere, where it becomes a being of pure thought. His body becomes catatonic and remains that way until he downloads his consciousness back into his body. If his body dies, he becomes trapped in the datasphere and is forever lost. While the user is merged with the datasphere, the difficulty of his Intellect rolls is reduced by two steps.In addition, the user can project a solid light hologram anywhere he chooses in the world. The hologram acts as a level 5 creature under the user's control. He can perceive and communicate through the hologram and decide how it acts and moves. If the hologram is reduced to 0 health, the user must wait at least one hour before he can create a new one.
Data Mine:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small disk that attaches to forehead, electronic bracelet, thick collar, stretchy gloves
  Effect: Allows the user to tap into the mind of anyone in visual range and steal the target's knowledge of a skill that it is trained in. The user becomes trained in that skill for one hour. During that time, the target loses its own training in that skill.
Data Spike:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Tiny spike
  Effect: A user activates the device by inserting it or having another character insert it into the base of his neck, angled upward so that it enters the brain stem. Installing the spike and removing it at a later time inflicts 1 point of damage that ignores Armor. A user can benefit from only one data spike at a time.Once the spike is installed, the user immediately connects to the datasphere and downloads information about a randomly determined skill into his mind. He becomes trained in that skill for a number of hours equal to the cypher level. If he is already trained in the skill, he instead becomes specialized.When a data spike is found, the GM can choose a skill or roll a d20 to determine the skill(s) randomly.

Data Vault:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Hourglass-shaped synth device with a ring around the center
  Effect: The device scans one object (chosen by the user) that can fit inside a 10-foot (3 m) cube and is within a short distance. The object then dissolves, its substance drawn into the device. Activating the device again causes it to create an identical copy of the object using solidified light at an open spot within a short distance.
Deadly Mist:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Wrist-mounted sprayer
  Usable: Canister with a short hose
  Effect: This cypher sprays a mist of exotic fluid at one or more targets within immediate range (potentially all targets in range, if the user desires). The mist condenses on the targets and gathers into a thick liquid that begins to form hard, razor-sharp edges, needles, spikes, and barbs that inflict damage equal to the cypher level. Affected targets suffer half the damage on the next round as well before the fluid turns back into mist and evaporates.
Death Messenger:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: A pair of metal or organic wings on a frame that can be attached to any detonation cypher
  Effect: To activate the device, the user places a bit of skin, hair, nail, or some other material from a living creature inside a compartment positioned between the wings. The wings begin to flap, causing the device to lift into the air and fly off toward the creature whose materials were used to activate it. The device uses the datasphere to locate the creature and speeds off toward it by the shortest and fastest available route. The device flies about 30 mph (48 kph) and maneuvers around obstacles. If blocked by a solid object, it goes out of phase, along with the cypher it carries, and moves through the object until it emerges into an open space. The device activates its detonation cypher when it reaches the target or after 28 hours, whichever comes first.
Deficiency Detector:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Two small disks. One attaches to the user. The other, when thrown, seeks out and attaches to the nearest living creature in long range.
  Effect: When the disk hits its target and attaches, it relays information about the target's weakness to the user. This information decreases the difficulty of the user's next interaction with the target by one step. If the user relays the weakness to others, the difficulty of their next interaction with the target is also decreased by one step.
Demonsphere:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: A 6-inch (15 cm) orb of steel lattice with a reflective red sphere in the center
  Effect: This is a dangerous cypher to use, perhaps giving rise to its name. When activated, it creates a horrific sound, a combination of shrill shrieks and low rumbling (which also might account for its name). At the same time, red streaks of energy lance out at a number of intelligent targets within short range equal to the cypher level. If there are more targets than streaks of energy, the targets are determined randomly, meaning that the user could be a target.The streaks of energy are extradimensional conduits tying the targets to an ultraterrestrial intelligence with a level equal to the cypher level. The intelligence attempts to control the targets' actions for one round per cypher level. (Eligible targets include machine intelligences or any living creature more substantial than an insect.) The ultraterrestrial intelligence has a motive and understanding all its own, but it is utterly alien. Thus, it can do almost anything, but if desired, roll d100 each round instead:Roll Target's action
  Roll:
   - 01–10 Scream
   - 11–20 Make incomprehensible gestures
   - 21–40 Attack the nearest creature
   - 41–55 Attack the nearest object

Deployer (Atmospheric):
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Wristband projector (long range), arm- or shoulder-mounted launcher (long range)
  Usable: Handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Once initiated, the device collects the most widely available atmospheric aerosols within long range (such as drit dust, water droplets, pollen, bacteria, or smoke). It brings those aerosols together in a whirling tornado that centers around the device itself. Anything in close range of the tornado takes damage equal to the cypher level.
Deployer (Hypersound):
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Once initiated, the device causes all audible sound waves within long range to gather in a single wave of inaudible hypersound. This wave then carries the sound directly to the ears of the user, allowing him to hear everything while at the same time creating absolute silence for everyone else in long range.
Deployer (Muscular):
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Injector, pill
  Usable: Needle projector, blow gun (short range)
  Effect: Once the material enters a living body, it begins to rearrange the skeletal muscle tissue of the creature in an orderly fashion to allow muscles to be used at their maximum capacity. For the next ten minutes, the difficulty of all Speed-based tasks (including Speed defense) is decreased by one step.
Deployer (Optical):
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Once initiated, the device manipulates the path of electromagnetic radiation through specific parts of the light spectrum. In doing so, it shields the user from view, essentially rendering her invisible, for one hour.

  Usable: Small synth bag approximately 1 foot by 1 foot by 3 inches (0.3 m by 0.3 m by 8 cm)
  Effect: Completely dries out any object placed in the bag within ten minutes. Living creatures put into the bag take damage equal to the cypher level.
Detonation (Crystal):
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Crystal shard the size of a fist (thrown, short range)
  Effect: Explodes with wild energy and crystal shrapnel. The shrapnel strikes in a short radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher level. The energy extends to a long radius and inflicts 4 points of damage that ignores Armor.
Detonation (Distress):
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range), handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Explodes in an immediate radius with blue vapors. Anyone in the area becomes nauseated and spends one round per cypher level vomiting and incapacitated in pain, unable to take actions.

  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range), handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Explodes with foam in an immediate area. The foam inflicts no damage but hardens immediately, filling the area with resilient, spongy matter. Those trapped in the foam can break free only by using their Might or perhaps a cutting tool (which would take at least a minute). The foam disintegrates after one hour.
Detonation (Healing):
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range), handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Explodes to release a burst of warm energy in a short radius. The energy restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the Pools (or health) of everyone in the area.
Detonation (Living Metal):
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Metal sphere (thrown, short range)
  Effect: Explodes in a short radius, spraying shards of liquid metal that inflict damage equal to the cypher level. The shards then drop to the ground or other nearby surface and slither along toward the point of detonation, where they rejoin. This process takes about three rounds. If it is not somehow prevented, the detonation explodes again, inflicting 1 fewer point of damage than before.
Detonation (Plant Transformation):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range), handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: "Explodes in an immediate radius with a grey mist. Living creatures affected in the area begin to transform into plants. Player characters exposed to the mist must attempt three Might defense rolls (any Effort used on one roll is applied to all three). The final result depends on the result of the rolls:No successes: Over the course of ten minutes, the character's flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. He permanently turns into a human-shaped plant.One success: Over the course of ten minutes, the character's flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. Her body stiffens and she cannot move for 28 hours as she takes root. At the end of that time, she becomes a human-shaped plant. However, if someone keeps her from taking root, she returns to normal over the course of another 28 hours, during which time she can take no actions.Two successes: Over the course of ten minutes, the character's flesh turns green and begins to sprout shoots. This is a painful process. At the ten-minute mark, he moves one step down the damage track, and he remains that way until he returns to normal 28 hours later.Three successes: The character is not affected at all.NPCs in the area who are one level lower than the cypher are affected as if they had two successes. NPCs who are two or three levels lower are affected as if they had one success. NPCs who are four or more levels lower than the cypher are affected as if they had no successes. All plants in the area gain a permanent +1 level boost."
Detonation (Smoke):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Wristband projector (long range)
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range), handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Bursts in a short radius, filling the area with thick smoke that lasts for one minute. A strong wind disperses it immediately. Treat the smoke as darkness, and the difficulty of melee attacks in the area is modified by one step in the defender's favor.
Detonation (Spatial Warping):
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range), handheld projector (long range)

Detonation (Stasis):
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range), handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Explodes in an immediate radius with strange energies. All creatures within the area are held in temporal stasis for one minute, during which time they cannot take actions or be affected in any manner.
Detonation (Tendril):
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Explosive device or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range), handheld projector (long range)
  Effect: Bursts into a swirling mass of dozens of animate tendrils that emerge from the point of explosion. The tendrils attack every creature and unattended object within immediate range. If successful, they hold their victim fast for up to six rounds unless the victim can break free (small or fragile objects are simply crushed and destroyed).
Detonation Delay:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small wired device
  Effect: The device can be attached to almost any type of detonation cypher to delay its activation. The user can set the timer for one minute, ten minutes, or 28 hours. Provided that the delay or detonation is not found and dismantled ahead of time, the detonation explodes at the preset time.
Detonation Trigger:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Wristband transmitter (long range) and a small patch or bundle of nanowires
  Effect: The nanowires can be attached to almost any type of detonation cypher. The user can then remotely trigger the device using the wristband transmitter. The detonation must be within long range, but it doesn't need to be in the user's vision.
Device Enhancer:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Tiny metal and synth chip
  Effect: If affixed to another cypher or artifact, that device is enhanced in one of the following ways (roll a d6):1 The device now also inflicts 4 points ofdamage if used on a target other than theuser. If the device already inflicts damage,the damage is increased by 2 points. If used on an artifact, this effect lasts for 28hours after the first use.2 The device, when activated, also projects a force field around the user that lasts for an hour. This field provides +2 to Armor. If the device already creates protective Armor, that Armor gains +1 instead. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact.3 The device, when activated, also adds 1 tothe user's Might Edge, Speed Edge, andIntellect Edge for one hour. This functionsonce, regardless of whether the enhanceddevice is a cypher or an artifact.4 If the device has immediate range, the range is increased to short. If short, it is increased to long. If long, it is increased to 200 feet (61 m). Such changes to the device last for 28 hours. If the device does not have a ranged effect, it instead affects the user when activated so that the user moves a long distance on an action for 28 hours. This latter effect can be used once.5 The device, when activated, also makes theuser invisible for an hour. While invisiblethe user is specialized in stealth and Speeddefense tasks. This effect ends if he doessomething to reveal his presence orposition—attacking, performing an esotery,using an ability, and so on. If this occurs,he can regain the remaining invisibilityeffect by taking an action to focus onhiding his position. This functions once,regardless of whether the enhanced deviceis a cypher or an artifact.6 The device now also restores a total of 4 points each time it is activated. The user can allocate those points among his stat Pools as desired, but the Pools cannot go above their maximum. If the device already restores points to Pools, it restores 2 additional points. If used on an artifact, this effect lasts for 28 hours after the first use.
Dimensional Sheath:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Belt, headband, bracelet
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: User is enveloped in invisible energy for six hours. During this time, she has +1 to Armor against any type of energy attack (including those that normally ignore Armor) and is immune to any effect that would change her phase state, send her to another universe, teleport her, or do anything similar.
Dimensional Trap:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Complex device
  Effect: One creature or object within immediate range disappears and is drawn into the device, where it remains for 28 hours. When the effect ends, the target reappears in an open space (chosen by the user of the device) within immediate range.
Displacement Cloak:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Cloak, cape, mantle
  Effect: For the next ten minutes, the user disappears and an image of her appears somewhere within immediate range. The image is a perfect copy of the user and mimics her physical movements and actions. The difficulty of her Speed defense rolls is reduced by three steps until the effect ends.
Dissonance Cube:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Complex device
  Effect: Activation causes the device to emit a subsonic noise for seven hours. At the end of each hour, any metal object within long range of the device takes 4 points of ambient damage.
Distortion Field Emitter:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: Subdermal injection
  Wearable: Helmet, headband, metallic choker
  Usable: Complex device
  Effect: Activation creates an invisible field that extends out from the device to short range for the next hour. Numenera devices do not function while in the field.
Doomsday Device:
  Level: 10
  Internal: Subdermal injection
  Usable: Explosive device
  Effect: When activated, the user sets a timer for up to one year. When the time runs out, the device explodes out to a range of 1 mile (2 km). The explosion inflicts 20 points of damage to everything in the area and saturates the air and ground with radiation that lasts for 5d20 years. Until the radiation dissipates, it inflicts 1 point of ambient damage for each minute a creature remains in the area.
Drastic Propulsion:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Small black box with a hook that attaches to a piece of clothing
  Effect: When activated, the device propels the user quickly in the direction he desires, allowing him to cover twice the usual amount of ground each round. If the user is holding tightly to another person or creature, that person or creature moves with him at the same speed. The effect lasts for one minute.
Dreamachine:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Hood, mask, head halo
  Usable: Standalone device
  Effect: The device creates pulsing light, sound, or some other combination of stimuli designed to alter the brain's electrical oscillations. When the user sits within close range of the device for at least ten minutes with his eyes closed, he enters a hypnagogic state. This allows his mind to open to the wonders of the datasphere, granting him the answer to a single question.
Dry Water:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Tiny marble made from ceramic, stone, or glass
  Effect: The device activates when exposed to water. It instantly expands into water with a volume of 1 gallon (4 L) per cypher level.
Duplicator:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Synth cylinder etched with fine, glowing lines
  Effect: When one end of the device is touched against a creature, a mass of gelatin sprays out the other end. Within three rounds, the gelatin creates what appears to be an exact living copy of the touched creature, including clothing and equipment, but it's a spongy facade. The copy is a level 1 creature with minimal intelligence that follows simple commands, but complex thought and emotions are beyond its capabilities. The copy lasts up to 28 hours, at which time it melts and evaporates.
Dynamic Hourglass:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: When the user activates the device, she disappears. She is removed from existence until the next round ends, at which point she returns to the same spot she left (or the nearest open space to that spot). At any time within the next 28 hours, she can take an extra action on her turn.
Ear Worm:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: A tiny worm covered in sharp hairs
  Effect: The cypher activates when placed on someone's face. The worm crawls up the side of the user's face and enters his ear canal (or the closest thing to an ear canal the user has). It then embeds the bristles coating its body into the canal. For the next 28 hours, the user can understand any language he hears and has an asset for any task that involves listening. When the effect ends, a fleshy moth flies out of his ear.
Echo Crystal:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon
  Effect: When the device is activated, the crystal projects a second weapon in the air formed from solidified light. It follows the weapon it copies, floating through the air and mimicking the original's movements. Whenever the user takes an action to attack with the original weapon, he makes an additional attack with the copy as part of the same action. The second weapon inflicts the same damage as the original. After 28 hours, the copy dissipates into a cloud of sparkling motes.
Ecstasy Glass:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Spectacles, goggles, helmet with visor
  Usable: Six joined glass spheres
  Effect: The device takes over the user's senses for one hour and floods them with profound pleasure. The user cannot see, hear, smell, taste, or feel anything in her surroundings during this time. Instead, she experiences whatever she most desires, and she believes that she is engaged in an activity that produces great and lasting pleasure. The experience might be eating a sumptuous meal, engaging in a sexual act with one or more people she desires, or simply sitting comfortably in a beautiful landscape. When the effect ends, she feels restored and may immediately make a recovery roll. This recovery roll does not count against the limits on the number of recovery rolls that she can make in a day.
Effulgent Body:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Syringe, pill, ingestible liquid
  Effect: Injects a fluorescent protein gene into the user, causing her to glow with a bioluminescent light that illuminates the area around her (within close range) as though it were daylight. The effect lasts for one hour.

  Wearable: Small nodule that affixes to nose, synth nose that attaches over a real one, clip-on nose ring
  Effect: "This device enhances the wearer's sense of smell, allowing him to detect odor signatures of various biological, biochemical, or chemical compounds for one hour. Those with knowledge of the numenera can attempt to “set” the nose to a desired substance just prior to using it (difficulty equal to the cypher level), or the GM can roll ahead of time:"
  Roll:
   - 01–10 Explosives or detonations
   - 11–30 Disease
   - 31–40 Blood
   - 41–50 Poison
   - 51–75 Chemical traps

Emoacoustic Weapon:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Mask
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: "This device allows the user to change the emotion of a single target in short range with a sonic burst that only the target will hear. The user can choose one of these emotions or states: anger, despair, fear, joy, calm, great hunger, and sexual arousal. This artificial state lasts for ten minutes (or as the situation afterward dictates)."
Energy Module:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Small metal and synth plate
  Effect: This cypher must be attached to another cypher or artifact (a level 4 task) that produces energy, such as a ray emitter or a force shield projector. Once attached, it no longer counts against a character's cypher limit. The level of the device it is attached to is increased by 2. The module cannot be removed from the device without destroying both the module and the device.
Energy Siphon:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small metal device
  Effect: When activated, this small metal device hovers around the user, and any energy attack (such as a nano's force blast or a beam from a ray emitter) strikes the cypher instead. The device is not harmed by the attack. Once activated, the energy siphon functions for one hour.
Energy Token:
  Level: 1d10
  Usable: Glowing ball of energy
  Effect: "This cypher functions when it is touched by a living creature (perhaps even before it can be identified), although it can be manipulated by tools such as tongs and safely stored if well away from a creature. Normal gloves or a leather bag is not enough to keep it from activating. The ball bathes a living creature touching it with energy of a type and effect depending on its color (roll a d20):"
  Roll:
   - 1–2 Blue: Reorganizes brain connections;+1 to Intellect Edge for one hour.
   - 3–4 Red: Restructures skeletal structure; +1 to Might Edge for one hour.
   - 5–6 Green: Alters musculature; +1 to SpeedEdge for one hour.
   - 7–8 Yellow: Alters respiratory system; grants immunity to dangerous gases. User can also breathe a puff of poisonous vapor at a victim in immediate range that inflicts 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) for a number of rounds equal to cypher level. The effect lasts for one hour.
   - 9–10 Orange: Changes physical density; +1to Armor, and user deals 2 additionalpoints of damage with melee attacks.
   - 11–12 Violet: Tunes dimensional phase of entire body; user can move through solid matter at a rate of 6 inches (15 cm) per round for ten minutes.
   - 13–14 Brown: Alters cellular relationship withgravity; user can move through the airas easily as on a solid surface for tenminutes.
   - 15–18 Black: Infuses cells with disruptive energy; inflicts 5 points of damage to user, and then user's touch inflicts 8 points of damage to others for ten minutes.

Eraser:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: A small metallic device
  Effect: Causes an object that can fit inside a 5-foot (2 m) cube or one creature it touches to instantly disappear from existence.
Erosion Ray:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Emits a beam at an object within short range. The beam weakens an amount of material that can fit inside a 10-foot (3 m) cube. The target does not appear to change, but it assumes the hardness of thin paper. A creature can easily tear chunks from the object or punch through it. If the user targets a section of floor, anything weighing at least 5 pounds (2 kg) that moves across that section falls through it. The effect can also weaken structures such as bridges, walls, and the like at the GM's discretion.
Essence Transfer:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Allows one willing character to transfer points from his Pools to another character's Pools. The transferring character can't reduce a Pool below 1, and the receiving character can't raise a Pool above its normal maximum.
Exalted Vapor:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Electronic smoking implement
  Wearable: Smoking mask
  Effect: "Allows the user to inhale a potent chemical that restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to one random Pool. Roll d100:"

   - 51–75 Speed Pool
   - 76–00 Intellect Pool
Explosive Nodule:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the weapon the nodule is attached to strikes a solid creature or object, it releases a pulse of concussive force that throws the target a short distance away from the user. This force knocks the target and the user to the ground.
Eyebug:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Small mechanical insect and a small eyepiece lens
  Effect: Once activated, this device moves on its own for one hour, following a single, simple verbal command with surprising intelligence. For example, if directed to find a way into the chamber to the south, it will search around, attempting to find the most direct path (if one exists), even one that is not known to the user. If told to find the nearest ithsyn, it will search around on its own until it finds the target (or until its hour is up). The device cannot be given multiple objectives, nor can it be given multistep directions. Most important, during the entire time, the user can see everything it can see through the eyepiece. The eyebug can see in the dark as easily as in the light.
Eyestalk Graft:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: A large bulbous eye with a 6-inch (15 cm) stalk
  Effect: This organic object grafts directly and immediately onto the flesh of the user's head. The eyestalk functions for 28 hours, during which time the user has an asset for all perception tasks and can look surreptitiously around corners.
Fact Finder:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Glove with a mechanical device in the palm, headband with mechanical device
  Effect: When someone wears the device and it is activated, the wearer should be asked three simple questions. These questions allow the device's mechanics to calibrate to the wearer's response. After that, the device will shock the wearer (doing damage equal to the cypher level) every time he says something that is not true. The effect lasts for five questions (in addition to the original calibration questions).
Fallback Clone:
  Level: 10
  Wearable: Two headbands
  Effect: To activate this device, the user must place a few drops of blood, strands of hair, nail clippings, or a piece of flesh in a sealed, water-filled tank with one of the headbands and wear the other one. The headband in the tank facilitates the rapid growth of a clone in one month. The clone is a fully grown creature, identical in every physical way to the user. However, it has no consciousness and remains in a comatose state in the tank. Once the clone has matured, if at any time the user dies while wearing the headband, her consciousness is transferred into the clone, regardless of distance. All skills, abilities, and knowledge are transferred.The user does not need to wear the headband throughout the process (if, for example, she is worried about her cypher limit)—just at the beginning to spur the clone's growth. However, if she dies while not wearing the headband, no transfer occurs.
Fangs of the Reaver:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: 2-inch (5 cm) metal sphere
  Effect: Upon activation, the sphere opens to reveal nasty metal teeth. It flies at a single target within short range that the user chooses, and it attacks as a creature of a level equal to the cypher level. It continues to attack that target for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level or until the target is dead, whichever comes first.
Fast Hail:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Cooled capsule filled with pressurized compound
  Effect: When firmly shaken and then projected via a ranged weapon of any kind, the capsule explodes, sending pressurized streams of large water droplets into the air. Within one minute, the droplets form hailstones about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Everything within the hailstorm takes damage equal to the cypher level. The storm lasts for 10 minutes.
Fertility Barrier :
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Effect: Once ingested, it prevents conception for one week. If a fertility barrier is used by both parties, it increases the chance of conception (decreases the difficulty by one step) for the same amount of time.
Firebreather:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Mouth guard, mouth sprayer, long tube
  Effect: The wearer breathes fire onto a foe in immediate range, doing damage equal to the cypher level. Inserting the device is an action. However, breathing fire is an Enabler and can be used in addition to a melee attack or movement.
Flame Catcher:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Complex device
  Effect: Causes all fire within a short distance to safely flow into the device. At any time within the next seven hours, anyone holding the device can release the stored flames in a stream about 1 foot (0.3 m) wide that extends out to short range. The flames inflict damage equal to the cypher level to one target within range.
Flame Hand:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Glove with a large metal device fitted over it
  Effect: Although this cypher is a glove, the wearer cannot use his hand while wearing it—a heavy metal device with a long tube on the end fits over the glove, encompassing his entire hand. When activated, this device sprays a stream of flaming liquid up to short range that inflicts damage equal to the cypher level. The wearer can spray this stream around to affect multiple targets and hit as many as are next to each other in range. (If he need not worry about hitting friendly targets, he could potentially attack all foes within range.)
Flesh Eater:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Wristband sprayer (long range)
  Usable: Balloon or ceramic sphere (thrown, short range)
  Effect: Bursts in an immediate radius, eating away any organic matter that it comes into contact with. Living creatures take damage equal to the cypher level.
Floating Bubble:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Ring, bracelet
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Upon activation, the user is encapsulated in a bubble of force for ten minutes. This bubble floats at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air at all times but moves as the user wishes (requiring an action to do so, just like normal movement) vertically or horizontally, up to a short distance each round. The user cannot penetrate the bubble, and neither can forces from the outside. Not even ambient damage gets through. Dealing at least 50 points of damage to the bubble (which has no Armor) destroys it. Damaging the bubble does not harm the user inside until the bubble is destroyed, at which point he falls from whatever height the bubble was at, which is at least 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air.
Flow:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid, ingestible powder
  Effect: Enables the user to move more rapidly by harnessing momentum gained from movement. Once per round, when the user takes an action to move, she gains another action that she must use at once. She can use this action only to move. The effect wears off after one hour.
Flowstone:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Steel or glass jar containing thick grease
  Effect: The user activates the item by applying the contents to a stone surface. There is enough grease to coat a 5-foot (2 m) radius area. It takes one minute for the stone to absorb the grease. At the end of this time, the stone gains the consistency of soft clay to a depth of 5 feet (2 m). The effect lasts for one hour. At the end of this time, the stone returns to its normal hardness.
Fluttering Recorder:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Tiny insect made from metal
  Effect: Activation causes the device to sprout tiny wings and flutter up into the air, waiting for instructions. The user can give the device specific directions to travel to a place within 3 miles (5 km) of where it was activated. The cypher follows the directions it was given, exactly as they were given, until it can travel no farther or it arrives at its destination. There, it waits for one hour, recording everything it sees and hears. At the end of this time, the cypher flies back to where it received the instructions and plays back the recording by projecting the images it witnessed onto a flat surface and playing the audio through the speakers in its body. It repeats the recording 1d6 times and deactivates.
Flying Cap:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Hat, helmet
  Effect: Three metal poles extend out from the top of the device, which clamps onto the user's head and cannot be removed for the duration. Two poles fold down on either side of the user's head, while the third rises straight up and sprouts four blades that begin spinning. The blades function as a propeller and lift the user into the air. She can control the direction of the movement by using the poles to either side. The device allows her to fly by making a Speed roll (level 2) each round. She can fly a short distance each round in combat or about 1 mile (2 km) each minute. The device operates for 3d20 minutes before breaking up and deactivating. If the user is still in the air when it stops working, she falls.
Foam Limb:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Canister
  Effect: If sprayed upon a creature, the foam builds an arm with a hand that mimics one of the creature's existing limbs in appearance, if possible. (If not applicable, the default limb is a long, sinewy arm with a three-fingered hand.) The foam arm hardens to the consistency of the creature's flesh and can be used by the creature as if it were its own. The new arm does not grant the creature additional actions or attacks in a round, but it can be useful for carrying things. If the arm is harmed, the creature suffers no ill effect. The arm lasts for 28 hours.
Foam Sprayer:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Canister
  Effect: "This device sprays foam on a target within immediate range. There is enough foam to cover up to three humans standing next to each other (or one larger target). Different kinds of foam have different effects. Roll a d6 to determine the foam in a given canister:"
  Roll:
   - 1 Hardens: All movement is halved, and thedifficulty of all physical actions is increasedby two steps for ten minutes.
   - 2 Caustic: The foam burns like acid, inflicting 4 points of damage on the first round and 2 points of damage on the second round before becoming harmless.
   - 3 Caustic and hardens: All movement ishalved, the difficulty of all physical actionsis increased by two steps for ten minutes,and the target suffers 4 points of damage.
   - 4 Dampens energy: If sprayed upon any numenera item (or if the target is in possession of numenera items), the item's effective level is lowered by 4 for ten minutes. If this effect reduces the level of the item to 0, the item will not function for that time. Nonpowered numenera items, like pills, are not affected.
   - 5 Dissolves metal: The level of a metalitem covered in the foam is lowered by4 permanently. If this effect reduces thelevel of the metal to 0, the item isdestroyed.
   - 6 Dissolves metal and dampens energy: The level of a metal item covered in the foam is lowered by 4 permanently. If this effect reduces the level of the metal to 0, the item is destroyed. Numenera items coated by the foam also have their level effectively lowered by 4 for ten minutes. If this effect reduces the level of the item to 0 or less, the item will not function for that time. Nonpowered numenera items, like pills, are not dampened.
Fool Killer:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: 2-inch (5 cm) crystal tetrahedron
  Effect: When activated, this crystal flies into the air and seeks the least intelligent sentient creature in long range, which takes one round. After finding its target, the crystal fires a bolt of energy similar to lightning at the creature. The bolt inflicts 10 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).
Fungal Garden:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Vial filled with multicolored dust
  Effect: "When a user pours out the contents of the vial, the dust sinks into any earthen or sandy surface it touches. One hour later, a field of mushrooms grows from the ground in a long radius centered on the spot where the dust fell. The mushrooms grow until they reach about 10 feet (3 m) tall on average. Each mushroom has a wide, colorful cap that spreads out in a 6-foot (2 m) radius.Touching a mushroom causes spores to fall from the cap onto anything below. Each time this happens, roll a d6 to see what the spores do to all creatures they touch.Roll a d6 for effect:"
  Roll:
   - 1–2 Bliss. The target experiences profoundfeelings of joy and happiness for one day.
   - 3–4 Sadness. The target experiences profound feelings of sadness for one day.
   - 5–6 Hallucinations. The target experiencesvisual and auditory hallucinations forone day. The hallucinations increase thedifficulty of any task that involves seeingor hearing by one step.
Gel Suit:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: A large container filled with gel
  Effect: To activate the device, the user must place his hand or foot into the container. The gel flows over his appendage and spreads across his body until it completely encases him. The gel retains its semiliquid consistency for 28 hours.While the gel covers the user, it prevents him from taking damage from acid, cold, electricity, or fire. In addition, whenever he takes damage from being struck by an object, he temporarily gains +1 to Armor until the next round ends as the gel briefly hardens in response to the hit.
Ghostly Duplicate:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Bracelet, necklace, ring
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: When activated, an incorporeal duplicate of the user appears and remains for ten minutes. The duplicate does not have a mind of its own. Rather, the user controls both forms, but only one at a time. Switching consciousness between forms is an action. While the user's consciousness focuses on one form, the other stands motionless. The duplicate moves at the same speed as the user's normal form, but there is no limit to how far apart the two can be.The duplicate is ghostly and translucent. It can pass through solid matter and cannot be harmed except by special transdimensional weapons and effects. It likewise cannot affect normal matter in any way. While moving as the incorporeal duplicate, the user gains an asset for all stealth tasks. When the duplicate's duration ends (or it is somehow destroyed), the user's mind returns to his normal body. If the normal body is slain, the user stays in the duplicate, but only for the remaining duration.
Ghostly Intruder:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Teleports the user to a location within sight and within long range. When she arrives, she is invisible for up to ten minutes. While invisible, she is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if she does something to reveal her presence or position, such as attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, she can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding her position.
Ghostly Veil:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Metamaterial compound in a jar, tube, or box (enough for one application)
  Effect: When applied to armor or a weapon, the metamaterial refracts light around the object, rending it nearly invisible for one hour. For anyone wearing veiled armor or using a veiled weapon, the difficulty of all tasks involving sneaking, being stealthy, and hiding is decreased by one step.
Glass Flame Pellets:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Handful of glass pellets
  Effect: If thrown—as a group—at the floor, the pellets burst into flame, filling the immediate area with fierce flames that burn for 28 hours, inflicting 6 points of damage to anyone in or passing through the area. There is just barely enough time for a character to drop the pellets and move out of the area of the fire in one action.
Glass Scorpion:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Small scorpion made of glass
  Effect: When activated, the glass scorpion immediately moves in the direction it is pointed until it comes upon a living creature at least the size of a hound. It then attacks with the needlelike stinger in its tail as a creature of a level equal to the cypher level. The scorpion injects a poison that inflicts 3 points of damage per round for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.
Glowing Tracker:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Wristband projector (long range)
  Usable: Handheld projector (long range); can be thrown against a hard object (short range)
  Effect: The device explodes in a shower of gel filled with neon gas, covering everything within immediate range in brilliant green and orange. The color can be seen in the dark up to 1 mile (2 km) away and lasts for one hour.
Goss:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A small, moist tongue
  Effect: To activate the cypher, the user must place it under her tongue and then speak for up to one minute. The device records everything she says. At the end of this time, she can place it anywhere she chooses. For the next day, the device repeats whatever she said in her voice and tone to anyone who moves within 10 feet (3 m) of it. Once the device repeats the recording, it makes no further noise until another creature approaches, at which point it begins the speech all over again. When the effect ends, the device breaks up into chunks of foul-smelling filth.
Grasshopper:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Wrist projector, shoulder launcher (launched, long range)
  Usable: Firm synth ball (thrown, short range)
  Effect: When thrown, the grasshopper bounces 1d6 times about 5 feet (2 m) apart, setting off an explosion of shrapnel in each place it lands. Each explosion deals damage equal to the cypher level to all creatures in the immediate area of the bounce.
Gravity Dampener:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Medallion, ring, boots
  Effect: The device automatically activates whenever its user falls 10 feet (3 m) or more. The user floats down until he lands safely, taking no damage from the fall.
Gravity Nodule:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon
  Effect: For the next 28 hours, the weapon the nodule is attached to seems to defy some element of gravitational pull, sliding faster through the air to seek and strike its target. The nodule essentially turns a heavy weapon into a medium weapon (usable in one hand) or a medium weapon into a light weapon (lowering the difficulty of attacks by one step). If attached to a light weapon, the nodule reduces the difficulty of attacks by another step. Damage remains unchanged in all cases.
Ground Orb:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Unfolds into a clear, padded synth orb about 8 feet (2 m) in diameter, with a large door that swings open. Once inside, the user can strap herself in and voice-program the orb with a location. The orb will roll to said location with the user inside, increasing travel speed along a road to about 5 miles (8 km) per hour and overland travel speed to about 4 miles (6 km) per hour during long-term movement.Unfolding the orb is an action. Getting inside and programming it is also an action.
Grow Ray:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Projector ray
  Effect: An inanimate object in short range grows twenty times its normal size and remains that way for 28 hours. The object's mass increases as well, but not at the same rate—only enough to keep it from collapsing in on itself.
Growth Harness:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Harness that fits around the user's torso
  Effect: This device draws mass to the user from another dimension, allowing her to grow 50 percent larger for one hour. During this time, she gains 12 points to her Might Pool and deals 2 additional points of damage with all melee attacks.
Growth Serum:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Liquid that is injected or swallowed
  Effect: The user permanently grows a foot taller. This process is painful and takes 28 hours, during which time the affected character is impaired.
Growth Stimulator:
  Level: 1d10
  Usable: Spray bottle, aerosol projector
  Effect: One plant touched by the liquid grows to ten times its normal, full-grown size in ten minutes. If conditions can't support the plant, it soon dies.
Grub Armor:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Canister of dried worms
  Effect: This cypher requires a bit of water to activate the dried worms in the can. Once activated, the grubs grow to enormous size in 1d6 rounds and swarm over the user's body, providing +2 to Armor for one hour. Further, if the user is targeted by an effect that specifically affects a single creature, such as something that controls or reads her mind, one of the grubs is affected instead, effectively rendering the user immune to such things for the duration. This does not apply to straightforward physical attacks of any kind.
Gyre Loop:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Complex device, handheld device
  Effect: Generates a strong wind that blows in a path 5 feet (2 m) wide and 500 feet (152 m) long. The wind blows for one hour. The wind is strong enough to scatter papers and loose, lightweight objects, cause flames to gutter out, and drive back tiny creatures. The wind can also fill a sail to propel a wind-powered vehicle. The user can change the direction of the wind by simply moving the device so it faces a different way.
Habiliment Mirage:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Lapel pin, bracelet, ring
  Effect: The user activates the device and scans the resulting small beam of light over a piece of clothing, armor, or other accoutrement within long range. The device then creates a hologram of that outfit over and around the user, making it seem as if he is wearing it, right down to the details. The illusion lasts for one hour or until the device is removed from the user's person.
Hand of the Conqueror:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Thin glove
  Effect: When activated, this thin glove becomes as tough as the hardest metal. Punch attacks made by the wearer inflict 1 additional point of damage. Further, the wearer's hand can't be harmed. He can handle hot lava or stick his hand into a grinder and suffer no ill effects (though the grinder might be wrecked). The effect lasts for 28 hours.
Hanging Cocoon:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: After being given a firm shake, this device expands into a tapered, hanging, semienclosed tent large enough for one person. It can easily be hung from anything that will support the weight of a human. Opening and hanging the cocoon is a single action. Climbing into it is also an action. It lasts for one day before it begins to dissolve.
Harassing Companion:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Metal cube
  Effect: When activated, this cube becomes a small flying automaton that harasses a target for one minute. It flies at the target, getting in the way of his eyes, his movements, and so on. The difficulty of the target's actions is increased by one step. At any time, the user can take an action to command the automaton to bother a different target within short range.
Head Transference Collar:
  Level: 8
  Usable: Adjustable metal ring
  Effect: This collar fits around the neck of most creatures the size of a human or so. When activated, it slices the head cleanly from the body and preserves the head (and mind) of the creature for up to ten minutes, during which time the creature is fully conscious.If the headless body of another creature that has been dead for less than one hour is available, the head preserved by the collar can be grafted onto that body. Henceforth, the head now controls its new body as if it had always been its own. This is very likely to alter Might and Speed Pools (but not Intellect Pool) and possibly other qualities as well.
Healing Nodule:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon
  Effect: Once activated, this nodule functions for ten minutes. Whenever the weapon that the nodule is affixed to strikes a foe (or any hard surface), 1 point is restored to the wielder's Might Pool. The nodule cannot restore more than 1 point per round.
Health Symbiote:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Inhalable powder
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: Activation inflicts 1 point of ambient damage as the symbiote becomes established in the user's system. For the next 28 hours, the user is immune to diseases, poisons, and other toxins.
Health Viewer:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Contact lenses, monocle, goggles
  Usable: Small transparent panel
  Effect: Allows the user to see through clothing and skin to view a creature's insides. Lead blocks the special vision. The user can use this ability as an asset for any healing-related tasks. Once activated, the cypher functions for ten minutes.
Heartbeat Lock:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A 3-foot (1 m) coil of thin copper wire with a flat round disk on each end
  Effect: By placing the disks against the user's chest for one minute, the device becomes synchronized with her heartbeat. After this, if the disks are pushed together, they form a seal that can be broken only when the device is exposed to the original heartbeat. Opening the lock destroys the locking mechanism.
Heartburst:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Internal: Pill, implant
  Wearable: Ring, bracelet, pendant
  Effect: This device is keyed to the heartbeat of the user. If he dies, the device explodes, inflicting damage equal to the cypher level to all within immediate range.
Heartlink:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Internal: Pill, implant
  Wearable: Ring, bracelet, pendant
  Effect: This device is keyed to the heartbeat of the user, so that if he dies, a designated intelligent creature will be informed telepathically.
Heat Sheath:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Spray canister
  Effect: This spray can coat up to one melee weapon per cypher level, but all of the canister's contents must be sprayed at once. Coated weapons inflict 1 additional point of damage from the heat they now generate. The coating wears off after 28 hours.
Heat Stone:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Lump of rock hanging from a necklace or set in a ring
  Effect: The device activates when the user would take damage from heat or fire. The device reduces the damage to 0 and makes the user immune to heat and fire for one hour.
Heatvision Lenses:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Eye drops
  Wearable: Eyeglasses, goggles, contact lenses
  Effect: Allows the user to see infrared light for one hour. Warm creatures and objects register as bright reds, oranges, and yellows, while cool areas appear blue, purple, or black. The device allows the wearer to see in total darkness, though fine detail is impossible. A hot light source (such as the sun) effectively blinds the user while the source is in his field of view.
Heliolithic Halo:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Metallic ring 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter
  Effect: When activated, the ring hovers about 3 inches (8 cm) over a living creature and creates a psychic shield of white light to protect that creature. For the protected creature, the difficulty of all Intellect defense tasks is decreased by one step for one hour. Requires a sun prayer to activate (activation is an action).
Hidden Reviver:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Elaborate hair pin, locket necklace, double bracelet
  Effect: This device is always disguised as a wearable object. When worn, the device does not count against your cypher limit. To use the device, you must first dismantle the disguised object and then rebuild it into its proper form as a handheld device. Then it can revive a depleted artifact for a single additional use. One action to build the reviver from the parts, and one action to attempt to use it.
History Tap:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Small disk that attaches to forehead, electronic bracelet, thick collar, stretchy gloves
  Effect: As soon as you put on the device, it begins to pulse with a heat that runs along your skin and directly to your brain. If you think of a human or visitant that you've heard of but never met, the device grants you access to one random moment in that individual's life. You see the moment as if in a dream and may remember only parts of it once the experience is over.
Homunculus:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: "Causes a small blister to appear somewhere on the user's body 1d6 days after activation. Every day thereafter for six days, the blister grows. After six days, the blister becomes so large that the difficulty of all the user's rolls increases by one step. On day twelve, the blister reaches its ultimate size: a massive, fluid-filled sac that leaves the user incapacitated for a full 28 hours. When the last hour ends, the blister splits open and leaks a yellow slick of phlegmy substance. In the midst of the mess is a level 1 creature about 18 inches (46 cm) tall. The creature can talk in any language the user knows and accompanies him wherever he goes, following his instructions. It vaguely resembles the user but is ugly and misshapen. It knows everything the user knows, and when it helps him perform a task other than attack or defend, the difficulty of the task is decreased by one step."
Hover Module:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Small metal and synth plate
  Effect: This cypher must be attached to another cypher or artifact (a level 4 task). Once attached, it no longer counts against a character's cypher limit. The cypher or artifact it is attached to can be placed in the air and will remain there until someone grabs it and deactivates the hover property. The module cannot be removed from the device without destroying both the module and the device.
Indestructible Oil:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A small amount of oil, likely in a jar or flask
  Effect: If a character coats an inanimate object with this oil, the object becomes almost indestructible (treat as level 10 for durability). One dose is enough for a single object about the size of a sword, a shield, or a small case.
Inertia Shield:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Belt, body harness
  Effect: An energy field surrounds the user for ten minutes. No physical object can penetrate the shield if that object is moving with any force that could be constituted as an attack. The field would deflect a strike from a broadsword or a bolt fired from a crossbow. Attacks using physical objects inflict no damage on the user until the effect ends.
Inflatable Companion:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Self-inflating blow-up companion
  Effect: Small device self-inflates into a companion that is roughly 4 feet (1 m) tall. It is a creature of a level equal to the cypher level and can understand verbal commands of the character who activates it. Once the companion has been activated, commanding it is not an action. It can make attacks or perform actions as ordered to the best of its abilities, but it cannot speak.The companion has short-range movement but never goes farther than long range away from the character who activated it. The companion is not artificially intelligent or capable of initiating action other than performing its purpose, as designated by its form. The GM should roll d100 ahead of time to decide what form the companion takes.
  Roll:
   - 01–50 Attack creature: Takes the form ofan aggressive creature in the NinthWorld that does damage equal to thecypher level. The creature lasts for tenminutes.
   - 51–75 Protective automaton: Takes the form of a sentient defense system (such as a floating shield) that absorbs 1 point of damage that would normally be taken by the user each round. The system lasts for one hour.
   - 76–00 Distracting humanoid: Takes the formof a humanoid figure that attempts tocreate a distraction. This causes thefoe to become dazed, increasing thedifficulty of all its tasks by one step.The humanoid lasts for three rounds.
Inflatable Suit:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Wearable: Full bodysuit
  Effect: Causes a number of bags to suddenly inflate all over the user's body. The inflated bags protect him from damage sustained from impacts, such as one resulting from a fall or a great concussive force. The bags remain inflated for one minute and then deflate with a tremendous noise. While the bags are inflated, the difficulty of the user's Might rolls and Speed rolls is increased by one step.
Insanity Mask:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: A metal mask with tiny holes in odd places and a locking mechanism in the back
  Effect: Anyone wearing the mask begins to slowly lose her mind. The mask causes 1d6 + 2 points of Intellect damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. Alternatively, if someone's Intellect Pool is already at 0, she can attempt to gain Intellect points by wearing the mask. Wearers who start with 0 in their Intellect Pool gain 1d6 – 2 Intellect points each round for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. If the resulting number is negative, the wearer takes those points out of the next Pool in succession. For example, if the wearer is at 0 Intellect points and rolls a natural 1, she loses 1 point from her Might Pool. If her Might Pool is already at 0, the point of damage comes out of her Speed Pool instead.
Instant Boat:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: With the addition of water and air, this small device expands into a simple boat. The boat is 10 feet long by 4 feet wide (3 m by 1 m) and is made from a type of lightweight molded foam that begins to disintegrate after a day.
Instant Companion:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Fist-sized organic pod
  Effect: If submerged in water, the pod grows quickly. In one minute, it grows into a houndlike beast of a level equal to the cypher level, with appropriate health, damage inflicted, and so on, plus 1 point of Armor. The hound obeys the user's commands (as best as it can, with only animal-level intelligence) for 28 hours or until it is slain, whichever comes first, at which point it dissolves into thick liquid.
Instant Guardian:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Fist-sized organic pod
  Effect: If submerged in water, the pod grows quickly. In one minute, it grows into a batlike creature of a level equal to the cypher level. The creature sits on the user's shoulder for 28 hours or until the user is attacked. The guardian moves to intercept the attack in its entirety. That is the only action it will take.
Instant Shield:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Ring, earring, hair pin, wristband, lapel pin
  Usable: Spray canister
  Effect: When activated by a simple voice command, the device instantly sends out a spray of molecules that harden into a protective wall in the air. The wall is 4 feet by 4 feet (1 m by 1 m). It provides Armor equal to the cypher level for two rounds.Activation is an action.
Instant Weapon:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Ring, earring, hair pin, wristband, lapel pin
  Usable: Spray canister
  Effect: When activated by a simple voice command, the device instantly emits a temporary light beam. For one round, the beam does damage equal to the cypher level to a foe in close range. The weapon must be activated and used as a single combined action.

Jolter:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Harness with wires connecting to a metal rod that can be held or affixed to the forearm
  Effect: When activated, this cypher generates a bolt of wild electricity that extends to short range before arcing into the ground or a target on the ground chosen by the user. The bolt inflicts damage equal to the cypher level, but the jolter is difficult to aim or control. The difficulty for any attack with the device is increased by one step, and a roll of 1 or 2 on the die suggests that a different target (if any) was struck. The jolter emits the bolt for four rounds, each round inflicting the same damage, but using it each round is an action and requires a new roll. There is no way to turn the jolter off once activated, so activating it is a four-round commitment. A user that does not control a jolter in a round will be struck by the bolt of electricity herself.
Kinetic Rod:
  Level: 1
  Usable: A metallic rod with an insulated handle (similar to a club)
  Effect: The user strikes the device against a solid surface, and the device absorbs the kinetic energy from the impact. The next time the user hits a target with an attack using the rod, the device releases the kinetic energy and inflicts 2 additional points of damage. Thereafter, this device functions as an ordinary club.
Leap Belt:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Wearable: Clamps onto belt

  Usable: Liquid contained in a tiny metal canister
  Effect: Adding the liquid to water raises the water's freezing point to 100 °F (38 °C). The water, as well as any other water in contact with it, freezes solid unless temperatures exceed the new freezing point. Anything in the water freezes with it and suffers 6 points of damage. Affected water returns to normal 1d20 days later.blocking a source of light, frees anything in the darkness that was affected by the device.
Light Flyer:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Small metal rod
  Effect: Once activated, the rod creates a winged glider about 12 feet (4 m) across beneath the user's feet. The flyer can move a long distance in a round, and it moves at the whim of the rider (requiring no action). It lasts for four hours, although if the user gets off the glider before then, it disappears, the effect ended.

  Usable: Capsule containing nanites and visible dust particles
  Effect: Opening the capsule and sprinkling its contents in an area about 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) causes the nanites to loosely create a projection of the events that recently occurred in that area, essentially re-enacting the previous ten minutes. The rendering is mostly created from large shapes and big movements. Smaller details are more difficult to make out.
Memory Gel:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Gel contained in metal or plastic tube with a screw cap
  Effect: Pouring out the tube's contents activates the device. The gel spreads over any object within immediate range that can fit inside a 10-foot (3 m) cube. Once the gel covers the object, it stays put for one minute, and then it withdraws and forms into a tiny, hard ball. At any time thereafter, a character can throw the ball a short distance. If it strikes a hard surface, the ball expands and takes the shape of the thing it covered. The material is as hard as metal and lasts until destroyed.
Mental Director:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Needled patch that adheres to flat, hairless skin
  Effect: Once applied, the patch “reads” the user's muscle action, allowing her to remotely (within long range) take a single action with another object that is her size or smaller as though she were touching it.

Mental Thieves:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Internal: Subdermal injection
  Effect: The user exhales a cloud of spores as he puts a question to a creature within immediate range. The spores infiltrate the target's body, find the answer in its thoughts, and forcefully eject themselves from the body, inflicting 2 points of damage to the target. The spores fly through the air and reenter the user's body, at which point he immediately learns the answer to the question, subject to the limits of the target's knowledge.
Metal Patch:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small metal plate
  Effect: When placed on a flat surface, the device affixes itself and rapidly expands until it becomes a plate that is 6 inches (15 cm) thick with a radius of up to 10 feet (3 m). Once in place, the device cannot be removed without destroying it.

Mind Module:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Small metal and synth plate
  Effect: This cypher must be attached to another cypher or artifact (a level 6 task). Once attached, it no longer counts against a character's cypher limit. The cypher or artifact it is attached to is now possessed of its own telepathic machine intelligence and can function on its own, obeying verbal or telepathic commands. For example, a detonation can be told to explode whenever someone in a particular uniform comes near. A windrider can be commanded to fly to a location on its own. The module cannot be removed from the device without destroying both the module and the device.
Mind Oculus:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Glass contact lens, monocle, spectacles
  Effect: Allows the wearer to create a mental connection to any living, sentient creature whose eyes they can look into for at least thirty seconds. Removing all language barriers, the mind oculus allows the wearer to ask a question that the creature should know the answer to, and get a truthful answer.

Mind Sled:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: The user falls unconscious, and one round later, a luminous crystal bloodlessly emerges from her head (the crystal is not considered a cypher). When the crystal is touched by another creature, the consciousness of the user wakes in the body of that creature (and the host's consciousness is temporarily submerged). For all intents and purposes, the user is the creature in all ways except personality. The user transfers back into her own body 28 hours later. If her body died in the meantime, there's a chance that her consciousness will remain in the host body, but most often, her personality merely burns out.
Mini Gate:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Metal sphere
  Effect: When activated, this device creates a tiny portal at the user's wrist and another at a spot within long range that she can see.

On the next action, the user can use the staff to open a portal and pull the ultraterrestrial into this world.The ultraterrestrial cannot resist, but once it arrives, it is not automatically compelled to do anything. Unless it can return under its own power or through some other means, it is in this world to stay.When the user finds an ultraterrestrial in the first step of this process, he can choose not to bring it into this world, but he cannot use the device to find another being.
Swarm Herder:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Adheres to temple and launches projectile
  Usable: Handheld device that launches projectile
  Effect: The device launches a tiny pointed capsule that moves at great speed. If it hits a living creature, it punctures the skin or exoskeleton and explodes, instantly releasing a compound of pheromones and impulse-controlling nanites. In response, the creature attempts to round up other members of its herd or group and move them away from combat to an area of perceived safety. If the creature is solitary, the cypher has no effect (or may cause it to attempt to round up whatever other creatures are nearby, including the PCs, as though they were part of its herd). The effect lasts for ten minutes.
Sweeping Glove:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Synth glove
  Effect: With a gesture (an action), the wearer can make any creatures or objects within immediate range fly backward up to 20 feet (6 m), essentially putting them in short range. Creatures affected suffer 2 points of ambient damage and are prone. The wearer can select which targets to affect. This glove functions for three rounds, during which time the wearer can perform this action each round.
Synth Corroder:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Wearable: Glove
  Usable: Wandlike device
  Effect: This device can be used in two ways. Either it can destroy a touched object made of synth that is small enough to be held in a human's hands, or it can destroy a 4-foot-by-4-foot-by-4-foot (1 m by 1 m by 1 m) area of a larger object made of synth. The object must have a level lower than the cypher level.
Talio's Compass:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Pinpoints a source of metal within living tissue and can draw it out. If used to remove a dangerous object (such as a projectile) from a living creature, the device restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the creature's Might Pool. If used to discover and remove a beneficial or benign object (such as an implant) from a living creature, the device does 2 points of damage.
Task Drone:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small winged device with a tendril ending in an hand
  Effect: When activated, this drone flies up to a long distance and performs one simple task with its tendril arm, such as pull a lever, open a door, lift an object, or push an object. Returning to the user can be a part of the task (so the drone can go get something and return with it). The drone has the strength of a normal human and is a creature of a level equal to the cypher level, with 1 Armor. It cannot make attacks and ceases to function after it performs its single task.
Teleport Seal:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Handheld device or crystal shard
  Effect: When activated, this device prevents all teleportation within 1 mile (2 km). No extradimensional gates function, and no phasing is possible in this area. The seal lasts for 28 hours.
Teleport Trap:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Paper-thin, flexible synth disk the size of a plate
  Effect: When the device is activated, the next person to touch the disk is teleported to a spot designated by the user, up to a long distance away. The destination must be a place known to be open (the target cannot teleport into solid matter), but it could be 100 feet (30 m) in the air, at the bottom of a deep pool, or a similarly inhospitable place.
Teleporter (Mass):
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Belt, wristband, ring
  Usable: Complex device, handheld device
  Effect: The user teleports herself and a number of other creatures equal to the cypher level. They can travel up to 100 × the cypher level in miles to a location she has previously visited. The group arrives safely with anything that they can carry, either individually or as a group.
Temporal Sheath:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Belt, headband, bracelet
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: The user is enveloped by invisible energy for six hours. During this time, she has +1 to Armor against any type of energy attack (including those that normally ignore Armor) and is immune to any effect that would alter time, hold her in stasis, or do anything similar.
Tendril Gloves:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Synth gloves that glow with traceries of light
  Effect: When the device is activated, the wearer can produce a 10-foot (3 m) tendril of solid light from each of his palms. These tendrils are prehensile and dexterous and as strong as the wearer. They can manipulate objects; wrap around, lift, and move objects; or be used as medium weapons. The tendrils remain for ten minutes.
Tether:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld projector (short range)
  Effect: Fires a metal spike at a target within range that inflicts 2 points of damage. Then, as part of the same action, the spike shoots a second metal spike at a different target within immediate range of it that inflicts the same damage. The spikes are connected by a tether. Until either target uses an action to remove the spike, neither target can move away from the other.
Third Man:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: When activated, the device creates the perception of an unseen presence among the party. This presence provides a sense of comfort and support to all members of the group (except the one who activated the device), giving them each an asset to a task of their choosing for one hour.
Time Auger:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld drill-like device
  Effect: Allows the user to “drill” through time the way that one might drill through wood. The user doesn't move through time, nor is he able to affect the past or the future. Instead, he creates a timehole that allows him to see thirty seconds into the future for the next ten minutes. As soon as he moves his eye away from the timehole, it collapses.
Time Capsule:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A metallic container large enough to hold a human-sized creature
  Effect: Anything placed inside the container does not experience time's passage for 1d20 years. At the end of this period, or if the contents are removed before then, the cypher becomes inert.
Time Delay:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Very small nodule
  Effect: This device can be affixed to any other cypher and activate it by timer. The user can set the timer for up to one week.
Tranquility Pod:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Submersion hood
  Effect: This device wraps around the user's head to provide a unique sensory experience, eliminating all external sounds, smells, and sights. Instead, the wearer experiences soothing sounds, soft light, and gentle vibrations. If he wears the pod for ten minutes, the experience restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to a single Pool of his choosing.
Transdimensional Gate:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Wearable: Belt with device, amulet, or ring
  Usable: Small handheld device
  Effect: This device creates a portal that leads to a different dimension, level of existence, or reality. It is automatically keyed to a specific destination determined by the GM, but a character can attempt to reorient it to another extradimensional destination that she is aware of (task difficulty equal to the cypher level). The portal is about 5 feet (2 m) in diameter and remains open for one minute, unless the user wishes it to close earlier (closing the portal is an action).
Transference Beam:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Usable: Large handheld device
  Effect: This device turns the user and up to six other individuals within immediate range into energy, which is then projected (at the speed of light) as a beam to a target destination that is in line of sight. When the beam reaches its destination, the travelers are turned back into matter along with their equipment, and their Might and Speed Pools are at maximum.
Transformation Torque:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Necklace made of malleable metal and biotech elements
  Effect: "Placing the necklace around your neck activates the device, which then sends small projections (similar to cilia) beneath the skin. These projections release a genetic compound that causes a mutation in the wearer for one hour.Additionally, the necklace houses a visage changer, which allows the wearer to hide his mutation if desired. If that's the case, the wearer gets the effects of the mutation but others cannot see, hear, or otherwise sense the mutation. Different necklaces have different effects. Roll d100:"
  Roll:
   - 01–50 Causes a beneficial mutation
   - 51–80 Causes a powerful mutation
   - 81–90 Causes a harmful mutation
   - 91–95 Causes a distinctive mutation
   - 96–00 Causes a cosmetic mutationTo determine the specific mutation caused by the device, GMs can choose or roll randomly on the mutation tables on page 124 in the Numenera corebook.
Transient Inscriber:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Handheld spray device or bottle and liquid brush, filled with a swarm of tiny bioluminescent, hydroponic creatures
  Effect: The device allows the user to write or draw a message on any living or nonliving object, covering up to 3 feet by 3 feet (1 m by 1 m). After a few minutes, the hydroponic creatures begin to dry out and their glow fades, rending the image invisible. The message or image can be seen again by adding a drop of liquid to the general surface area. This causes the creatures to glow again for about one minute before they extinguish fully.
Transposer:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Belt with device, amulet, or ring
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: The user swaps positions with a creature of roughly similar size that it can see within long range.
True Speak:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: When the solution is injected into a creature, that creature cannot knowingly speak a lie for one hour.
Truth Inducer:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Glove, synth finger overlay, temporary fingertip tattoo
  Effect: One creature touched by the device answers questions truthfully for one minute.
Variable Tool:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Small handheld device
  Effect: The device becomes a mundane weapon, adventuring item, or common or rare special item for one hour.
Verdant Nectar:
  Level: 1d6
  Internal: Ingestible liquid
  Usable: Injector
  Effect: Causes the user's skin to turn green for ten days. Until the effect wears off, the user does not need to eat during a day provided that he spends at least four hours in sunlight during that day. The hours need not be consecutive.
Vision Subjugator:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: "Inhibits brain function in a target within short range for one hour so that the target's vision is affected. The user can specify one category of creatures, objects, substances, and so on that the victim cannot see. The effect is extremely specific, so that if “humans” are selected, the victim cannot see people but would still see clothing worn, objects carried, and so on. Possible categories might include (but are not limited to): metal, vapor, water, mammals, synth, weapons, numenera, the color blue, and plants. It's worth noting that this does not grant the victim X-ray vision. If he cannot see stone and he stands next to a stone wall, his brain creates what he sees instead out of whole cloth based on the context of what he can see. This can lead to seriously delusional behavior."
Volcanic Heart:
  Level: 10
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: This device does nothing upon activation or in the next two rounds. In the fourth round, it begins to create intense heat. This heat does 12 points of damage to all creatures within immediate range, 6 points of damage to all within short range, and 3 points of damage to all within long range. This effect lasts for three rounds. After that, damage within all ranges starts to fade at a rate of 1 point of damage per round.
War Mites:
  Level: 1d6 + 1
  Usable: Spray canister
  Effect: A stream of tiny mites sprays out of the canister when this cypher is activated. They strike a single target in immediate range. The target is covered by these bioengineered mites, which immediately begin biting and stinging the target. The target takes 1 point of damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. Further, during each of these rounds, the target is distracted, and the difficulty of all tasks it undertakes is increased by one step.
Warming Pouch:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: Cloth bag
  Effect: When you put an object into the cloth bag and activate the string closure, the object heats to human body temperature within one minute. If the object isn't removed, the pouch will keep it at body temperature for 28 hours.
Water Weapon:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: Wrist-mounted device
  Usable: Handheld device
  Effect: Fires a bolt of energy through water at a target within long range, inflicting damage equal to the cypher level. The energy must have water to conduct it or the device will not function, so both weapon and target must be at least partially submerged.
Way Back:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Belt bag
  Effect: When activated and hung from the user's belt, bag, or similar gear, the device releases contained droplets of radioluminescent light every 50 feet (15 m). The droplets stay dark for one day, then crack with light and become visible for five days.
Weaver Drone:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A spiderlike automaton equipped with a 50-foot (15 m) spool of strong synth cable
  Effect: Responding to simple voice commands, the weaver drone can climb almost any surface, releasing the strong synth cable out behind it as it travels in a simple or complex pattern. Once the cable runs out, the drone anchors itself (and the end of the cable) to a designated place and shuts down permanently. As long as the cable is anchored by the drone, it can sustain the weight of up to two average-sized people at a time.
Wing Symbiote:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Wearable: A large winged insect that attaches to the user's spine
  Effect: The device inflicts 2 points of damage to the user as it digs its claws into her spine and uses a tendril to burrow into her brain stem. For the next 28 hours, the user can fly by making a Speed roll (level 1) each round. In combat, she moves a short distance each round, but on extended trips, she can move up to 40 miles (64 km) per hour.
Wish Disk:
  Level: 10
  Usable: A set of metal disks nested within each other
  Effect: The user states a change in reality that she wishes to have happen, and it—or something very like it—occurs. This warping of reality can affect matter, energy, and time. Objects can be created or destroyed, creatures can be slain, and events from the past can be undone. Reality can be altered so that dead beings are still alive (because they never died). However, the minds of most users are insufficient to fully comprehend the vast implications of the reality they change. This means that the wish fulfillment may not be entirely what they thought it would be. The repercussions are too varied to list, but here are a few examples:• A complex object created is brittle, of poor quality, or made of a substance that turns out to be dangerous.• A significant change to the past results in a “bubble” of space-time in which the change occurred, trapping the user in a sort of limited closed dimension, even while normal, unchanged reality continues outside the bubble.• Creatures altered by the change develop health issues ranging from new allergies or minor ailments to cancer or mutations.• Minds altered by the change suffer from long-term trauma, confusion, memory loss, or brain damage.Using a wish disk is taxing. The user moves two steps down the damage track.
Witless Powder:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A thin metal tube with a fragile powder cartridge in the center
  Effect: To activate the device, the user blows through one end of the tube to propel the cartridge's contents out the other at a creature within immediate range. If the creature is hit by the powder, and its level is equal to or lower than the cypher level, it becomes stunned for one minute. During this time, if the user speaks to the target in a language the target can understand, she can implant a suggestion in the target's mind. This suggestion is a course of activity the target must follow under the specific conditions the user describes. The course of activity can be anything she chooses, though it cannot be anything that poses a significant risk to the target's life, property, or loved ones. The conditions can be as general or as specific as the user decides. If the described conditions happen during the next 28 hours, the target behaves as instructed.
Wrist Launcher:
  Level: 1d6
  Wearable: Wrist-mounted device
  Effect: Launches a small object (such as a dart, a stone, or a detonation cypher) up to long range. If the object is hard (preferably pointed), it inflicts 4 points of damage. A detonation inflicts its own explosive damage.
X-ray Extractor:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Usable: Glass panel with selection of dials
  Effect: When held up against a solid surface, this panel allows the user to see through up to 2 feet (0.6 m) of material. The selection of dials allows him to discriminate between various items within the material, permitting him to see buried objects, supports in walls, or organs in a body. A successful difficulty 4 Intellect roll vaporizes a visualized discrete object or a portion of it. An unsuccessful roll disintegrates a random chunk of material, gouging a hole in the solid surface. The device operates for one minute, and it works only if the cypher's level is higher than the material's level.
Polar Touch:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Form: Long pike with a softly glowing nodule at the tip rather than a sharp point
  Effect: The tip of this long melee weapon drastically and immediately lowers the temperature of whatever it touches. A target struck by this weapon suffers points of damage equal to the artifact's level. Use of a polar touch underwater (which is most of the time) also freezes the water around the target. Characters who fail a Might defense roll are hindered for one round, which increases the difficulty of all physical actions by one step.
  Depletion: 1 in 1d20
Safe Distance:
  Level: 1d6 + 2
  Usable: A cube about 1.5 inches (4 cm) to a side, made of utterly ordinary stone
  Effect: The space between the user and an adjacent target increases to a long distance. The device literally “stretches” space to accomplish this—or to put it another way, the device expands space. This is a permanent change.
Transposition:
  Level: 1d6
  Usable: A cube about 1.5 inches (4 cm) to a side, made of utterly ordinary stone
  Effect: The user and one object or creature within long range switch places in space.
Boiling Rod:
  Level: 1d6 + 3
  Form: Short baton with a glowing red nodule at one tip
  Effect: Inflicts points of damage equal to the artifact's level on anyone touched by the tip. Use of a boiling rod underwater (which is most of the time) creates a cloud of steamy bubbles that obscure vision like fog. They persist for one round after each use.
  Depletion: 1 in 1d20
Burster:
  Level: 1d6 + 4
  Form: Pair of synth spheres with a curved handle
  Effect: Affects a target within short range, causing a terrible rent to burst in its flesh. Against a nonliving target, the burster likewise tears matter apart, expanding the space between the existing portions. The potential victim makes a Might defense roll. On a success, nothing occurs. On a failure, the victim sustains damage equal to the artifact's level.
  Depletion: 1 in 1d20
