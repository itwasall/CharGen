  background:
    Intensive Training: You are strong, fast, or both, but what really separates you from the crowd is your training. Perhaps you ascended the highest peak of the Black Riage or sought the deepest sewers beneath Qi to find teachers who could show you how to move, fight, and endure beyond normal human limits. You know a thousand ways to kill a foe, most of them secret to all but a chosen few. You’re privy to techniques and fighting styles that most people in the Ninth World have never seen. You have learned that the impossible is possible— as long as you know the secret. Your body is a weapon, and your weapon is part of your body. You have studied with the masters, and now you carry that regimen as you venture into the world.
    Inborn Traits: "You’ve trained under excellent instructors and have experience in many dangerous situations, but what makes you different is deep inside, entwined in your genetic heritage. Maybe it was the luck of being born fit. Maybe you’re a hulking brute—a mountainous figure who commands attention when you enter a room. Or maybe your strength is more subtle; you might be the descendant of a bioengineered species bred (or designed) for perfection. Perhaps you’re a mutant with psychic abilities that augment your physical nature; you guide and enhance your attacks with telekinesis, or you use a natural mutation in your brain to control matter on a molecular level to resist blows and inflict harm. Perhaps you’re something wholly new: an aberration or a human so perfect that you’re beyond human. You might be a posthuman—the next step toward the true destiny of the people of the Ninth World"
    Biomechanical Modification: You might be a fighter, but you’re no archaic stereotype—this is the Ninth World, after all. Although you trained and gained your share of practical experience, you have the numenera on your side as well. Some of your knowledge of fighting techniques is implanted in your brain and spine, wired into your nerves and muscles. Your joints have surgically implanted servo motors. Subdermal plating makes you tougher than should be possible. Your muscle tissue is augmented with artificial fibers. Perhaps your genetic code has been rewritten by engineered viruses, or the tissues in your body have been reworked by nanotech, turning you into an efficient battle machine. Or maybe you’ve been altered by strange science—radioactive treatments of bizarre energies, chemical compounds and drugs, or extradimensional enhancements—that makes you stronger, faster, tougher, and more proficient in attack and defense than anyone around you. Whatever the case, you’re the result of ancient knowledge made manifest in the present, and now you’re shaping the future. Perhaps your modifications are obvious and visible; perhaps they’re not. Regardless, you know that you’re more than merely human.
  intrusions:
    Perfect Setup: You’re fighting at least three foes and each one is standing in exactly the right spot for you to use a move you trained in long ago, allowing you to attack all three as a single action. Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action.       
    Old Friend: A comrade in arms from your past shows up unexpectedly and provides aid in whatever you’re doing. They are on a mission of their own and can’t stay longer than it takes to help out, chat a while after, and perhaps share a quick meal.
    Weapon Break: Your foe’s weapon has a weak spot and in the course of the combat quickly becomes damaged and moves two steps down the object damage track.

        desc: "You can perform small tricks: temporarily change the color or basic appearance of a small object, cause small objects to float through the air, clean a small area, mend a broken object, prepare (but not create) good, and so on. You can't use Hedge Magic to harm another creature or object. Action."
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Onslaught:
        desc: You attack a foe using energies that assail either their physical form or their mind. In either case, you must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you emit a short-range ray of force that inflicts 4 points of damage. If the attack is mental, you focus your mental energy to blast the thought processes of another creature within short range. This mindslice inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage (and thus ignores Armor). Some creatures without minds (such as automatons) might be immune to your mindslice. Action.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Push:
        desc: You push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller,  must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you can’t use this esotery to pull a lever or even close a door. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Scan:
        desc: You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level (a measure of how powerful, dangerous, or difficult it is). You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and synth. You might learn that the glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this esotery doesn’t tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don’t know what the metal and synth device does. In the second, you don’t know if stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Ward:
        desc:You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler.

    - You studied in a school infamous for its dark, brooding instructors and graduates.
    - You learned nano-sorcery (or gained your modifications) in the temple of an obscure god. Its priests and worshippers, although small in number, respect and admire your talents and potential.
    - While traveling alone, you saved the life of a powerful abhuman brute. Although unwilling to accompany you on your journey, he remains indebted to you.
    - Your mother was a powerful nano while she lived, helpful to many locals. They look upon you kindly, but they also expect much from you.

    - You killed a well-known criminal in self-defense, earning the respect of many and the enmity of a dangerous few.
    - You trained as a glaive, but your skills with the numenera and other types of lore eventually led you down a different path. Your former comrades don’t understand you, but they respect you.
    - While studying to be a nano, you worked as an assistant for a seamstress, making friends with the owner and the clientele.
    - Your family owns a large vineyard nearby known to all for its fine wine and fair business dealings.

    - People you meet seem put off by the strange birthmark on your face.
    - Your best friend is also a nano. You and she share discoveries and secrets readily.
    - You know a local merchant very well. Since you give him so much business, he offers you discounts and special treatment.
    - You belong to a secretive social club that gathers monthly to drink and talk.
  background:
    Forbidden Knowledge: You understand the numenera far better than most people do. You know that it isn’t just strange machines buried in old ruins. The numenera is everywhere, beyond the perception of humans. You know that microscopic machines called nanites are threaded through every inch of the world, waiting to be activated. You know that satellites in orbit are broadcasting information, waiting for someone to access it. Having studied long and hard, learning the proper ways to tap into the forces all around you, you know how to activate these machines and make them do what you wish, at least in limited, specific ways. These uses of power are called esoteries. Through various tiny devices that you possess, which probably seem like magic charms to the uninitiated, you “conjure” energy. By accessing the datasphere transmitted across the world, you connect with machines—including the nanites—to change your environment.
    Psionics: You know that the world is filled with ancient machines and their creations. Some of them are visible, but many are not. It’s not just skill or knowledge that allows you to gain access to them. You have a psychic talent to interface with the machines to produce various effects. Some of these machines are secreted about your person, and others are infused into the environment of the Ninth World. You can’t conjure energy or warp matter on your own, but you have the rare and spectacular ability to control the invisible nano-machines that do it for you. Is this gift the natural result of extreme exposure to technology? Is it the fusion of the biological and the mechanical? Is it the design of a genius architect, generations earlier, who manipulated the genetics of your family? Or is it just a random mutation? In any case, you’re the natural synthesis of human and machine, working as one.
    Ports and Plugs: "You have a connection with machines for one clear reason: you’re practically a machine yourself. Your nervous system is laced with circuitry, and your body has implanted jacks and ports where you plug in modules and other technological bits that provide your capabilities. When you produce effects or manipulate nanites, you do so through your body’s direct mechanical interface. Your force blasts might come from a device implanted in your palm or fingertip. Your ability to tap into the datasphere might come from the receiver plugged into a port you built in the back of your neck. Obviously, to become a Nano, you have undergone numerous surgeries and procedures (either willingly or unwillingly). You are forever changed. Some people treat you with disdain or derision, but perhaps most of your modifications can be hidden by a hooded cloak or similar garment."
  intrusions:
    Advantageous Malfunction: A numenera device that is being used against you malfunctions. It might harm the user or one of their allies for a round, or activate a dramatic and distracting side effect for a few rounds.
    Convenient Glimmer: A glimmer provides you with a clear answer or suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re facing.
    Inexplicably Unbroken: An inactive, ruined, or presumed-destroyed device temporarily activates and performs a useful function relevant to the situation. This is enough to buy you some time for a better solution, alleviate a complication that was interfering with your abilities, or just get you one more use out of a depleted cypher or artifact.

      Create Deadly Poison:
        desc: You create one dose of a level 2 poison that inflicts 5 points of damage. You can apply this poison to a weapon, food, or drink as part of the action of creating it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the poison; each level of Effort used in this way increases the poison level by 1. If unused, the poison loses its potency after one hour. Action.
        cost: [3, Intellect]
      Critter Companion:
        desc: A level 1 creature accompanies you and follows your instructions. This creature is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg) and is normally some sort of domesticated species. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you’ll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The critter companion acts on your turn. As a level 1 creature, it has a target number of 3 and a 3 health, and it inflicts 1 point of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If your critter companion dies, you can search an urban or wild environment for 1d6 days to find a new companion. Enabler.
      Face Morph:
        desc: You alter your features and coloration for one hour, hiding your identity or impersonating someone. This affects only your face, not the rest of your body.

You must apply a level of Effort to be able to impersonate a different species. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Fleet of Foot:
        desc: You can move a short distance as part of another action. You can move a long distance as your entire action for a turn.

      Late Inspiration (3 Intellect points):
        desc: You retry a task you failed within the past one minute, using the same difficulty and modifiers, except this time you have an asset on the task. If this retry fails, you can’t use this ability to retry it again. Enabler.
        cost: [1, Speed]
      Link Senses:
        desc: You touch a willing creature and link its senses to yours for one minute. At any time during that duration, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell what that creature is experiencing, instead of using your own senses. If you or the creature move out of long range, the connection is broken. Action to initiate.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Phased Pocket:
        desc: You connect yourself for one hour to a small space that is out of phase and moves with you. You can access this space as if it were a convenient pocket or bag, but nobody else can perceive or access the space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space can hold up to 1 cubic foot. The space is a part of you, so you can’t use it to carry more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the space harms you, and so on. When the connection ends, anything in the space falls out. For each 2 additional Intellect points you spend, the pocket lasts an additional hour. Enabler.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Vanish:
        desc: You become invisible for a short amount of time. While invisible, you have an asset on stealth and Speed defense tasks. The invisibility ends at the end of your next turn, or if you do something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]

    - You worked alongside your father, who was skilled in many things, until he disappeared one day with no explanation.
    - You grew up on the streets and studied at the school of hard knocks.

    - You have a friend with an extensive library, plenty of food and drink, and a comfortable home—and the door is always open to you.
  backgrounds:
    Born Lucky: You seem to be better than most people because you are. Your ancestors were part of a genetic experiment, and your genes are superior to those of the average human. You’re smarter, stronger, more dexterous, and able to learn mental and physical skills more quickly. Folks might call you charismatic, blessed, divinely gifted, or just plain lucky. They probably said the same thing about your parents, their parents, and so on. Some of your genetic advantage might even grant you low-level psychic abilities that greatly resemble the “miracles” performed by Nanos.
    School of Hard Knocks: You learned things the hard way—on your own. Adaptive and canny, you express the true strengths of humanity in your ability to adjust quickly to circumstances, pick up new tricks to succeed, and ultimately survive when you probably should be dead. Most likely, you grew up on your own, perhaps on the streets, in the wilderness, or amid ruins. The details don’t really matter. What’s important is that you taught yourself how to overcome whatever challenges came along.
    A Cobbled Jumble: You’re the product of generations of eugenics, bolstered by minor cybernetic enhancements, a few small psychic abilities, and the lessons of secret masters. In other words, you don’t have one source of power or one explanation for your abilities—you have many, and as far as you’re concerned, that’s the best formula for success. You don’t put all your eggs in a single proverbial basket. To really get ahead, you must rely on multiple strengths. You’ve always got an unexpected trick up your sleeve or a fallback contingency. For example, you might have subdermal implants that make you more resilient, your training might let you sense a foe’s attack before he strikes, and your psychic abilities could allow you to push your enemy’s blade slightly to the left so you can just barely dodge it. In the end, you’re simply hard to hurt.
  intrusions:
    Familiar Insight: YOu know this person (or heard about them somehwere) well enough to give insight about their motives or intentions, and how best to convince them to see things your way. You know the right words, posturing, inflection, amount of emotional manipulation, or even what sort of joke or agreeable complaint might sway them. This can convince a neutral person to take your side, or a hostile one to hear you out for a little while longer.
    Inspirational Recall: You recall an important detail from a previous encounter (perhaps something you don’t even remember noticing at the time) that suggests a successful course of action for your current situation. This might be recognizing a password hidden in an innocuous code or riddle, realizing you saw a suspicious individual near a crime scene, overhearing an important conversation between two NPCs, or understanding that an NPC’s subtle glance or gesture had additional connotations indicating what you should do.
    Lucky Break: Something unexpected happens that is to your advantage. A rope your opponent is hanging from might snap, the person you’re debating in front of an influential Aeon Priest might trip or forget what they were going to say, or something that was supposed to last only a round or two lasts a little while longer.
