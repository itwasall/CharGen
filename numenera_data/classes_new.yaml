  background:
    Intensive Training: You are strong, fast, or both, but what really separates you from the crowd is your training. Perhaps you ascended the highest peak of the Black Riage or sought the deepest sewers beneath Qi to find teachers who could show you how to move, fight, and endure beyond normal human limits. You know a thousand ways to kill a foe, most of them secret to all but a chosen few. You’re privy to techniques and fighting styles that most people in the Ninth World have never seen. You have learned that the impossible is possible— as long as you know the secret. Your body is a weapon, and your weapon is part of your body. You have studied with the masters, and now you carry that regimen as you venture into the world.
    Inborn Traits: "You’ve trained under excellent instructors and have experience in many dangerous situations, but what makes you different is deep inside, entwined in your genetic heritage. Maybe it was the luck of being born fit. Maybe you’re a hulking brute—a mountainous figure who commands attention when you enter a room. Or maybe your strength is more subtle; you might be the descendant of a bioengineered species bred (or designed) for perfection. Perhaps you’re a mutant with psychic abilities that augment your physical nature; you guide and enhance your attacks with telekinesis, or you use a natural mutation in your brain to control matter on a molecular level to resist blows and inflict harm. Perhaps you’re something wholly new: an aberration or a human so perfect that you’re beyond human. You might be a posthuman—the next step toward the true destiny of the people of the Ninth World"
    Biomechanical Modification: You might be a fighter, but you’re no archaic stereotype—this is the Ninth World, after all. Although you trained and gained your share of practical experience, you have the numenera on your side as well. Some of your knowledge of fighting techniques is implanted in your brain and spine, wired into your nerves and muscles. Your joints have surgically implanted servo motors. Subdermal plating makes you tougher than should be possible. Your muscle tissue is augmented with artificial fibers. Perhaps your genetic code has been rewritten by engineered viruses, or the tissues in your body have been reworked by nanotech, turning you into an efficient battle machine. Or maybe you’ve been altered by strange science—radioactive treatments of bizarre energies, chemical compounds and drugs, or extradimensional enhancements—that makes you stronger, faster, tougher, and more proficient in attack and defense than anyone around you. Whatever the case, you’re the result of ancient knowledge made manifest in the present, and now you’re shaping the future. Perhaps your modifications are obvious and visible; perhaps they’re not. Regardless, you know that you’re more than merely human.
  intrusions:
    Perfect Setup: You’re fighting at least three foes and each one is standing in exactly the right spot for you to use a move you trained in long ago, allowing you to attack all three as a single action. Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action.       
    Old Friend: A comrade in arms from your past shows up unexpectedly and provides aid in whatever you’re doing. They are on a mission of their own and can’t stay longer than it takes to help out, chat a while after, and perhaps share a quick meal.
    Weapon Break: Your foe’s weapon has a weak spot and in the course of the combat quickly becomes damaged and moves two steps down the object damage track.

      Hedge Magic:
        desc: "You can perform small tricks: temporarily change the color or basic appearance of a small object, cause small objects to float through the air, clean a small area, mend a broken object, prepare (but not create) good, and so on. You can't use Hedge Magic to harm another creature or object. Action."
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Onslaught:
        desc: You attack a foe using energies that assail either their physical form or their mind. In either case, you must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you emit a short-range ray of force that inflicts 4 points of damage. If the attack is mental, you focus your mental energy to blast the thought processes of another creature within short range. This mindslice inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage (and thus ignores Armor). Some creatures without minds (such as automatons) might be immune to your mindslice. Action.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Push:
        desc: You push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller,  must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you can’t use this esotery to pull a lever or even close a door. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Scan:
        desc: You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level (a measure of how powerful, dangerous, or difficult it is). You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and synth. You might learn that the glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this esotery doesn’t tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don’t know what the metal and synth device does. In the second, you don’t know if stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Ward:
        desc:You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler.

    - You studied in a school infamous for its dark, brooding instructors and graduates.]
    - You learned nano-sorcery (or gained your modifications) in the temple of an obscure god. Its priests and worshippers, although small in number, respect and admire your talents and potential.
    - While traveling alone, you saved the life of a powerful abhuman brute. Although unwilling to accompany you on your journey, he remains indebted to you.
    - Your mother was a powerful nano while she lived, helpful to many locals. They look upon you kindly, but they also expect much from you.

    - You killed a well-known criminal in self-defense, earning the respect of many and the enmity of a dangerous few.
    - You trained as a glaive, but your skills with the numenera and other types of lore eventually led you down a different path. Your former comrades don’t understand you, but they respect you.
    - While studying to be a nano, you worked as an assistant for a seamstress, making friends with the owner and the clientele.
    - Your family owns a large vineyard nearby known to all for its fine wine and fair business dealings.
    - You trained for a time with a group of Aeon Priests, and they still look upon you with fondness.
    - You worked the gardens in the palace of an influential noble. She wouldn’t remember you, but you made friends with her young daughter.

    - You hail from a distant land where you were well known and regarded, but people here treat you with suspicion.
    - People you meet seem put off by the strange birthmark on your face.
    - Your best friend is also a nano. You and she share discoveries and secrets readily.
    - You know a local merchant very well. Since you give him so much business, he offers you discounts and special treatment.
    - You belong to a secretive social club that gathers monthly to drink and talk.
  background:
    Forbidden Knowledge: You understand the numenera far better than most people do. You know that it isn’t just strange machines buried in old ruins. The numenera is everywhere, beyond the perception of humans. You know that microscopic machines called nanites are threaded through every inch of the world, waiting to be activated. You know that satellites in orbit are broadcasting information, waiting for someone to access it. Having studied long and hard, learning the proper ways to tap into the forces all around you, you know how to activate these machines and make them do what you wish, at least in limited, specific ways. These uses of power are called esoteries. Through various tiny devices that you possess, which probably seem like magic charms to the uninitiated, you “conjure” energy. By accessing the datasphere transmitted across the world, you connect with machines—including the nanites—to change your environment.
    Psionics: You know that the world is filled with ancient machines and their creations. Some of them are visible, but many are not. It’s not just skill or knowledge that allows you to gain access to them. You have a psychic talent to interface with the machines to produce various effects. Some of these machines are secreted about your person, and others are infused into the environment of the Ninth World. You can’t conjure energy or warp matter on your own, but you have the rare and spectacular ability to control the invisible nano-machines that do it for you. Is this gift the natural result of extreme exposure to technology? Is it the fusion of the biological and the mechanical? Is it the design of a genius architect, generations earlier, who manipulated the genetics of your family? Or is it just a random mutation? In any case, you’re the natural synthesis of human and machine, working as one.
    Ports and Plugs: "You have a connection with machines for one clear reason: you’re practically a machine yourself. Your nervous system is laced with circuitry, and your body has implanted jacks and ports where you plug in modules and other technological bits that provide your capabilities. When you produce effects or manipulate nanites, you do so through your body’s direct mechanical interface. Your force blasts might come from a device implanted in your palm or fingertip. Your ability to tap into the datasphere might come from the receiver plugged into a port you built in the back of your neck. Obviously, to become a Nano, you have undergone numerous surgeries and procedures (either willingly or unwillingly). You are forever changed. Some people treat you with disdain or derision, but perhaps most of your modifications can be hidden by a hooded cloak or similar garment."
  intrusions:
    Advantageous Malfunction: A numenera device that is being used against you malfunctions. It might harm the user or one of their allies for a round, or activate a dramatic and distracting side effect for a few rounds.
    Convenient Glimmer: A glimmer provides you with a clear answer or suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re facing.
    Inexplicably Unbroken: An inactive, ruined, or presumed-destroyed device temporarily activates and performs a useful function relevant to the situation. This is enough to buy you some time for a better solution, alleviate a complication that was interfering with your abilities, or just get you one more use out of a depleted cypher or artifact.

    Community Ability:
      Fixer:
        desc: [*community, the community's effect rank for health and infrastructure is +1. You choose which is modified during any given community action. Enabler.]

      Trained in Armor:
        desc: You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You can wear any kind of armor. You reduce the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor by 1. Enabler.
      Create Deadly Poison:
        desc: You create one dose of a level 2 poison that inflicts 5 points of damage. You can apply this poison to a weapon, food, or drink as part of the action of creating it. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the poison; each level of Effort used in this way increases the poison level by 1. If unused, the poison loses its potency after one hour. Action.
        cost: [3, Intellect]
      Critter Companion:
        desc: A level 1 creature accompanies you and follows your instructions. This creature is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg) and is normally some sort of domesticated species. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you’ll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The critter companion acts on your turn. As a level 1 creature, it has a target number of 3 and a 3 health, and it inflicts 1 point of damage. Its movement is based on its creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on). If your critter companion dies, you can search an urban or wild environment for 1d6 days to find a new companion. Enabler.
      Face Morph:
        desc: You alter your features and coloration for one hour, hiding your identity or impersonating someone. This affects only your face, not the rest of your body.

You must apply a level of Effort to be able to impersonate a different species. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Fleet of Foot:
        desc: You can move a short distance as part of another action. You can move a long distance as your entire action for a turn.

        cost: [1, Speed]
      Link Senses:
        desc: You touch a willing creature and link its senses to yours for one minute. At any time during that duration, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell what that creature is experiencing, instead of using your own senses. If you or the creature move out of long range, the connection is broken. Action to initiate.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Phased Pocket:
        desc: You connect yourself for one hour to a small space that is out of phase and moves with you. You can access this space as if it were a convenient pocket or bag, but nobody else can perceive or access the space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space can hold up to 1 cubic foot. The space is a part of you, so you can’t use it to carry more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the space harms you, and so on. When the connection ends, anything in the space falls out. For each 2 additional Intellect points you spend, the pocket lasts an additional hour. Enabler.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Vanish:
        desc: You become invisible for a short amount of time. While invisible, you have an asset on stealth and Speed defense tasks. The invisibility ends at the end of your next turn, or if you do something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
  connection:
    - You come from a large family and had to fend for yourself from an early age.
    - Your older sister is a skilled nano. You weren’t able to follow her path, but the numenera is not unknown to you.
    - You’re a member of a guild of explorers who specialize in uncovering ancient mysteries.
    - You worked alongside your father, who was skilled in many things, until he disappeared one day with no explanation.
    - You grew up on the streets and studied at the school of hard knocks.
    - You remember little of your past, which has always seemed strange to you.
    - You came of age in the wild and are used to living rough.
    - Your family is wealthy but earns little respect from the locals.
    - You’re friends with many people in the community and are generally well regarded.
    - You have an annoying rival who always seems to get in your way or foil your plans.
    - You’re in love with a local shopkeeper, but that person shows little interest in you.
    - Several expeditions preparing to explore old ruins and odd mysteries would like you to join them because you seem like a promising addition to the team.
    - Your best friend from childhood is now an Aeon Priest.
    - You come from a nearby community, but the locals consider the folk of your hometown to be untrustworthy rivals.
    - You’re close friends with a local married couple, both of whom are experienced nanos.
    - You’re drinking buddies with a number of the local guards and glaives.
    - You once saved the child of a local noble from a fire, and she is very grateful.
    - You used to work with a troupe of traveling minstrels and performers, and they remember you fondly (as do people in the places you visited).
    - You’re wanted for a crime you didn’t commit.
    - You have a friend with an extensive library, plenty of food and drink, and a comfortable home—and the door is always open to you.
  backgrounds:
    Born Lucky: You seem to be better than most people because you are. Your ancestors were part of a genetic experiment, and your genes are superior to those of the average human. You’re smarter, stronger, more dexterous, and able to learn mental and physical skills more quickly. Folks might call you charismatic, blessed, divinely gifted, or just plain lucky. They probably said the same thing about your parents, their parents, and so on. Some of your genetic advantage might even grant you low-level psychic abilities that greatly resemble the “miracles” performed by Nanos.
    School of Hard Knocks: You learned things the hard way—on your own. Adaptive and canny, you express the true strengths of humanity in your ability to adjust quickly to circumstances, pick up new tricks to succeed, and ultimately survive when you probably should be dead. Most likely, you grew up on your own, perhaps on the streets, in the wilderness, or amid ruins. The details don’t really matter. What’s important is that you taught yourself how to overcome whatever challenges came along.
    A Cobbled Jumble: You’re the product of generations of eugenics, bolstered by minor cybernetic enhancements, a few small psychic abilities, and the lessons of secret masters. In other words, you don’t have one source of power or one explanation for your abilities—you have many, and as far as you’re concerned, that’s the best formula for success. You don’t put all your eggs in a single proverbial basket. To really get ahead, you must rely on multiple strengths. You’ve always got an unexpected trick up your sleeve or a fallback contingency. For example, you might have subdermal implants that make you more resilient, your training might let you sense a foe’s attack before he strikes, and your psychic abilities could allow you to push your enemy’s blade slightly to the left so you can just barely dodge it. In the end, you’re simply hard to hurt.
  intrusions:
    Familiar Insight: YOu know this person (or heard about them somehwere) well enough to give insight about their motives or intentions, and how best to convince them to see things your way. You know the right words, posturing, inflection, amount of emotional manipulation, or even what sort of joke or agreeable complaint might sway them. This can convince a neutral person to take your side, or a hostile one to hear you out for a little while longer.
    Inspirational Recall: You recall an important detail from a previous encounter (perhaps something you don’t even remember noticing at the time) that suggests a successful course of action for your current situation. This might be recognizing a password hidden in an innocuous code or riddle, realizing you saw a suspicious individual near a crime scene, overhearing an important conversation between two NPCs, or understanding that an NPC’s subtle glance or gesture had additional connotations indicating what you should do.
    Lucky Break: Something unexpected happens that is to your advantage. A rope your opponent is hanging from might snap, the person you’re debating in front of an influential Aeon Priest might trip or forget what they were going to say, or something that was supposed to last only a round or two lasts a little while longer.

Your demeanor is such that those who see you automatically understand that you are someone important, accomplished, and with authority. When you speak, strangers that are not already attacking give you at least a round to have your say. If speaking to a group that can understand you, you can attempt to have them produce their leader or ask that they take you to their leader. You gain a free level of Effort that can be applied to one persuasion task you attempt during this period. Action to initiate.

    skills:
      Anecdote:
        desc: You can lift the spirits of a group of creatures and help them bond together by entertaining them with an uplifting or pointed anecdote. For the next hour, those who pay attention to your story are trained in a task you choose that’s related to the anecdote, as long as it’s not an attack or defense task. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Babel:
        desc: Once each day, choose one language that you’ve encountered on which you will concentrate. For the rest of that day, you can speak that language with reasonable facility. You don’t lose the use of any other languages you know normally during this period. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete.
        cost: [3, Intellect]
      Connection With an Organization:
        desc: You have a general connection with an important organization, such as the Order of Truth, the Angulan Knights, the aristocracy of a region, a merchant guild, and so on. Tasks related to interacting with members of that group gain an asset. Further, you can use this connection to learn about events related to that organization’s focus. For instance, if you have a connection with the Angulan Knights, you may learn of events related to mutants in the area. You and the GM should work out the details together. You can choose this ability more than once and choose a new organization each time. Enabler.
      Goad:
        desc: You can attempt to goad a target into a belligerent—and probably foolish—reaction that requires the target to try to close the distance between you and attempt to physically strike you on its next turn. They attempt this action even if this would cause them to break formation or to give up cover or a tactically superior position. Whether the target strikes you or fails to do so, they come to their senses immediately afterward, after which further tasks attempting to goad the target again are hindered. Action to initiate.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Powerful Rhetoric:
        desc: After engaging a creature in conversation for at least a minute, you can attempt to influence how that creature is perceived, promoting it as a friend, dismissing it as a fool, or denouncing it as an enemy. Your words are so well chosen that even you and it are affected, because your conviction and its doubt are paramount. The accuracy of your assessment isn’t important as long as you keep up the rhetoric. From then on (or until you change your rhetoric or the creature offers a convincing defense to those who’ve heard your label), the friend’s social interactions gain an asset, the fool’s social interactions are hindered, or the enemy’s defenses are hindered. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Trained Without Armor:
        desc: You are trained in Speed defense actions when not wearing armor. Enabler.
      Understanding:

  background:
    Inborn Traits: You were born this way. Everyone always took to you. You always seemed to know the right thing to say. It all came naturally. Your voice was pleasant, your eyes shining and honest, and your face attractive. These qualities have always been strong enough that you could rely on them. While others studied a craft, learned to fight or steal, or tinkered with the numenera, you found that you could usually get what you needed and wanted by talking to people. Now, all this might come from a heritage of quality forebears, or it could come from something more. A silver-tongued Arkus like yourself might have inherited these qualities from your family, or you might benefit from subtle mutations that alter your voice and mannerisms to be perfect for influencing others. You don’t really know. You just know that you’ve always been this way and that, while you look just like everyone else, you’re different. Of course, no one ever need know that but you.
    Enhancements: You might be a leader, but you don’t fit the mold. Although you gained your share of practical experience in learning how to influence others, you have the numenera on your side as well. Some of your knowledge of rhetoric and ability to speak at an enhanced volume is due to biomechanical bits implanted in your brain and spine, wired into your nerves and muscles. Your vocal cords are woven with subtle resonant threads. Subdermal plating makes your appearance more symmetrical and pleasing. Your facial muscles are interlaced with small elements that give you complete control over your micro expressions. Alternatively, your genetic code could have been rewritten by engineered viruses, or the tissues in your body could have been reworked by nanotech, turning you into a paragon that others are drawn to. Or maybe you’ve been altered by strange science—radioactive treatments of bizarre energies, chemical compounds and drugs, or extradimensional enhancements—that makes you smarter and more able to see the implications of long-term planning than anyone around you. Whatever the case, you’re the result of ancient knowledge made manifest in the present, and now you’re shaping the future. Perhaps your modifications are obvious and visible; perhaps they’re not. Regardless, you know that you’re more than merely human.
    Training and Experience: You are eloquent, good-looking, or both, but what really separates you from the crowd is your training. Perhaps you worked as an intern with the Aeon Priests in Qi that work behind the scenes to lead the Order of Truth, where they taught you how to speak eloquently, debate convincingly, and synthesize the best plans from all those put forth. You know a thousand different ways to argue and influence. You learned how to read people to ascertain their moods, distinguish their truths from their lies, and determine what they want and what they need to hear. You got a lot of practice using your skills in public, starting small at first but working your way up to leading community movements and taking charge of short-term community projects.
  intrusions:
    Friendly NPC: An NPC you don’t know, someone you don’t know that well, or someone you know but who hasn’t been particularly friendly in the past chooses to help you, though doesn’t necessarily explain why. Maybe they’ll ask you for a favor in return afterward, depending on how much trouble they go to.
    Perfect Suggestion: A follower or other already-friendly NPC suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re facing.
    Unexpected Gift: An NPC hands you a physical gift you were not expecting, one that helps put the situation at ease if things seem strained, or provides you with a new insight for understanding the context of the situation if there’s something you’re failing to understand or grasp.

      inability: [Medium Weapons, Heavy Weapons]
    Skills:
      desc: You are trained in crafting numenera. In addition, you are trained in a crafting skill in which you are not already traine. Choose one of the following. You have an inability in salvaging numenera and understanding numenera. Enabler.
      option: [Salvaging Numenera, Understanding Numenera, Engineering, Woodcrafting, Armoring, Weaponsmithing]

    Community Ability:
      Builder:
        desc: [*community, +3 is added to the community's infrastrcture. Enabler]
    Always Tinkering:
      desc: If you have any tools or materials at all, and you are carrying fewer cyphers than your limit, you can create a cypher if you have an hour of time to spend. The new cypher is random and always 2 levels lower than normal (minimum 1). It's also tempermental and fragile. There are called tempermental cyphers. If you give it to anyone else to you, it falls apart immediately, useless. Action to initate, one hour to complete.
    Numenera Plans:

    skills:
      Additional Numenera Plans:
        desc: You gain two additional numenera plans. You can take this ability multiple times. Enabler.
      Deconstruct:
        desc: You take the time to closely study a bit of scrap, machine, cypher, artifact, or other numenera object or structure before attempting to salvage iotum from it. If the salvage source possesses iotum that can be salvaged (as determined by the GM), the salvage task gains an asset. In addition, you gain one additional iotum from the salvage attempt, which means one additional roll on the Iotum Result Table. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete.
        cost: [3, Intellect]
      Extra Use:
        desc: You attempt to gain an extra use from an installation or artifact without triggering a depletion roll. The difficulty of the task is equal to the level of the installation or artifact. If you crafted the installation or artifact, you gain an asset to the task. On a failure, the depletion roll occurs normally. You could also try to use a cypher without burning it out, but the task is hindered. A failed attempt to gain an additional use from a cypher destroys it before it can produce the desired effect. Action.
        cost: [3, Intellect]
      Natural Crafter:
        desc: All commonplace objects or structures you craft are effectively 1 level higher than an average example of that object or structure. For instance, if you craft a defensive wall that would normally be level 4, its effective level is 5. Enabler.
      Right Tool for the Job:
        desc: If you have at least 1 unit of iotum, you can fashion a temporary device that provides an asset to one physical, noncombat task, identified ahead of time. For example, if you need to climb a wall, you could create some sort of climbing assistance device; if you need to break out of a cell, you can tune iotum in your possession to serve as a lockpick; if you need to create a small distraction, you could trigger an iotum to make a loud bang and flash; and so on. Once fashioned, the adapted iotum lasts for about a minute or until used for the intended purpose. This use destroys the iotum. Action to prepare the iotum; action to initiate.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
        iotum_appending: 1
      Scan for Iotum:
        desc: Using a device or some kind of unique sense, you scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or structures. The area must be within immediate range. The difficulty of the task is equal to the level of the object or structure being scanned. Scanning in this fashion grants an asset to initial salvage tasks in the area to determine if anything is worth salvaging. This ability doesn’t improve your ability to find a specific kind of iotum, only to discover whether there is iotum within the salvage source in the first place. That said, many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Scramble Machine:
        desc: You render one machine within short range unable to function for one round. Alternatively, you can hinder any action by the machine (or by someone attempting to use the machine) for one minute. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Trained in Armor:
        desc: You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You can wear any kind of armor. You reduce the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor by 1. If you choose this as one of your starting inspired techniques, you start the game with armor of your choice. Enabler.
      Trigger Iotum Ray:
        desc: If you have at least 1 unit of iotum, you can trigger it to release a shortrange ray of force that inflicts 3 points of damage. This does not destroy the iotum. Alternatively, you can choose to have this destroy the iotum, in which case there is no Intellect cost. Action.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
        iotum_substitute: 1
  background:
      Unusual Upbringing: From a very early age, you had access to machines and tools, and you were encouraged to learn how to use them. Perhaps you were raised by a Nano or an Aeon Priest who thought building was more important than playing. Maybe your parents were obsessed with the numenera. Or perchance you were incubated and trained by machines who needed human ingenuity and creativity to solve a problem they couldn’t overcome. You stacked gears and circuits instead of wooden blocks, and your earliest drawings were schematics for toys you wanted to build. Your bedtime stories were about automatons, nanites, and electronics, and your dreams were filled with the wondrous things you would create with an endless supply of iotum and parts. When you grew older and prepared to set out on your own, you asked those who raised you what great work you could build for them as thanks for what they taught you—something contributing to their research, a device to overcome an infirmity, or even a new self-willed automaton to  join them. Now you search for a suitable plan, the iotum to craft it, or both.
      Unexpected Brilliance: "Your mind developed early, way before your peers. Your parents realized it and delighted in challenging you with puzzles and projects. You could fix household items, and eventually you found your true passion: taking apart oddities, scrap, and depleted cyphers. You figured out how to make broken machines work again, and honed your ability to recognize what a jumble of parts could do if you put them together in just the right configuration. Most people respected and appreciated your talent, some tried to exploit you, and a few feared you, but your incredible mind made sure you always came out ahead—or gave you enough of a head start to get away from serious trouble. Whence did your brilliance spring? Just an accident of nurture and nature? Did you have a great-grandparent who was equally skilled? Or is your facility with objects and structures something inherent in you, such as a mutation in your brain that gives you insights that others can’t imagine? It’s a mystery, and one you’d like 	to solve one day. But only after you finish your current list of crafting projects."
      Mechanical Indoctrination: The Prophecy was clear. If the machine that squatted at the center of town could not be awoken by midnight during the next eclipse, the Spear of God would strike like a burning sword from the void and blast everyone and everything to drit. You were one of the ones selected to awaken the Red Cube. You were schooled, drilled, and cypher-fed all manner of information, plans, knowledge, and even some physical know-how dripped into your blood by strange machines the city elders kept in dark basements. Others who were selected weakened and eventually died under the brutal regime of learning. It was rough on you, too, but where so many others failed, you succeeded. You learned. And with that knowledge, you repaired the machine and saved the city. But in the aftermath, you were different, both physically and psychologically. You weren’t taught how to craft things— it was programmed into you, hard-coded into your flesh and mind with drugs and technology, conditioned into your psyche with rep titive drills. You don’t know if the motivations of your captors/doctors/ instructors were noble or nefarious, but the end result is that building things is as natural for you as breathing. You can assemble basic components when you’re half asleep just by using muscle memory. You may even have subdermal implants that convert nutrition and bodily wastes into components you need. You  might feel like you were robbed of a normal childhood, or you might celebrate your strange education and embrace opportunities to learn and experience childish things with adult senses and intellect. In some ways, you are an organic machine built to create and repair other machines, but your skills are what allow you to survive and thrive in the Ninth World. Your goal may be to destroy those who created  you, better understand their motives, or push  orward their agenda.
  intrusions:
      Device Perfection: A device or installation works even better than you expected it would, at least in this instance. Maybe the range is twice as long, the duration is 100% longer, or the effect itself is 50% stronger.
      Crafting Insight: You are inspired, and you  finish crafting the object or structure earlier than was expected (maybe even halving the total time).
      Tinkering Vision: When using your Always Tinkering special ability, you discover that the materials you’re using are of unexpectedly high quality, giving you specific options to choose from. So instead of gaining a random cypher, you gain the cypher of your choice (though it’s still a temperamental cypher, so it’s 2 levels lower than normal and you can’t give it to someone else without destroying it).
