  background:
    Intensive Training: You are strong, fast, or both, but what really separates you from the crowd is your training. Perhaps you ascended the highest peak of the Black Riage or sought the deepest sewers beneath Qi to find teachers who could show you how to move, fight, and endure beyond normal human limits. You know a thousand ways to kill a foe, most of them secret to all but a chosen few. You’re privy to techniques and fighting styles that most people in the Ninth World have never seen. You have learned that the impossible is possible— as long as you know the secret. Your body is a weapon, and your weapon is part of your body. You have studied with the masters, and now you carry that regimen as you venture into the world.
    Inborn Traits: "You’ve trained under excellent instructors and have experience in many dangerous situations, but what makes you different is deep inside, entwined in your genetic heritage. Maybe it was the luck of being born fit. Maybe you’re a hulking brute—a mountainous figure who commands attention when you enter a room. Or maybe your strength is more subtle; you might be the descendant of a bioengineered species bred (or designed) for perfection. Perhaps you’re a mutant with psychic abilities that augment your physical nature; you guide and enhance your attacks with telekinesis, or you use a natural mutation in your brain to control matter on a molecular level to resist blows and inflict harm. Perhaps you’re something wholly new: an aberration or a human so perfect that you’re beyond human. You might be a posthuman—the next step toward the true destiny of the people of the Ninth World"
    Biomechanical Modification: You might be a fighter, but you’re no archaic stereotype—this is the Ninth World, after all. Although you trained and gained your share of practical experience, you have the numenera on your side as well. Some of your knowledge of fighting techniques is implanted in your brain and spine, wired into your nerves and muscles. Your joints have surgically implanted servo motors. Subdermal plating makes you tougher than should be possible. Your muscle tissue is augmented with artificial fibers. Perhaps your genetic code has been rewritten by engineered viruses, or the tissues in your body have been reworked by nanotech, turning you into an efficient battle machine. Or maybe you’ve been altered by strange science—radioactive treatments of bizarre energies, chemical compounds and drugs, or extradimensional enhancements—that makes you stronger, faster, tougher, and more proficient in attack and defense than anyone around you. Whatever the case, you’re the result of ancient knowledge made manifest in the present, and now you’re shaping the future. Perhaps your modifications are obvious and visible; perhaps they’re not. Regardless, you know that you’re more than merely human.
  intrusions:
    Perfect Setup: You’re fighting at least three foes and each one is standing in exactly the right spot for you to use a move you trained in long ago, allowing you to attack all three as a single action. Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action.       
    Old Friend: A comrade in arms from your past shows up unexpectedly and provides aid in whatever you’re doing. They are on a mission of their own and can’t stay longer than it takes to help out, chat a while after, and perhaps share a quick meal.
    Weapon Break: Your foe’s weapon has a weak spot and in the course of the combat quickly becomes damaged and moves two steps down the object damage track.

        desc: "You can perform small tricks: temporarily change the color or basic appearance of a small object, cause small objects to float through the air, clean a small area, mend a broken object, prepare (but not create) good, and so on. You can't use Hedge Magic to harm another creature or object. Action."
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Onslaught:
        desc: You attack a foe using energies that assail either their physical form or their mind. In either case, you must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you emit a short-range ray of force that inflicts 4 points of damage. If the attack is mental, you focus your mental energy to blast the thought processes of another creature within short range. This mindslice inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage (and thus ignores Armor). Some creatures without minds (such as automatons) might be immune to your mindslice. Action.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Push:
        desc: You push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller,  must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you can’t use this esotery to pull a lever or even close a door. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Scan:
        desc: You scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or creatures within that area. The area must be within short range. Scanning a creature or object always reveals its level (a measure of how powerful, dangerous, or difficult it is). You also learn whatever facts the GM feels are pertinent about the matter and energy in that area. For example, you might learn that the wooden box contains a device of metal and synth. You might learn that the glass cylinder is full of poisonous gas, and that its metal stand has an electrical field running through it that connects to a metal mesh in the floor. You might learn that the creature standing before you is a mammal with a small brain. However, this esotery doesn’t tell you what the information means. Thus, in the first example, you don’t know what the metal and synth device does. In the second, you don’t know if stepping on the floor causes the cylinder to release the gas. In the third, you might suspect that the creature is not very intelligent, but scans, like looks, can be deceiving. Many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Ward:
        desc:You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler.

      Aggression:
        desc: You reach into the mind of a character and unlock his more primitive instincts. Choose one character within short range. That character has an asset on Might-based attack rolls. The effect lasts for one minute. Action to initiate.
        cost: [ 2, Intellect ]
      Distortion:
        desc: You modify how a willing creature reflects light for one minute. Choose a creature within short range. The target rapidly shifts between its normal appearance and a blot of darkness. The target has an asset on Speed defense rolls until the effect wears off. Action to initiate.

      Erase Memories:
        desc: You reach into a creature’s mind to make it forget. Choose one creature within immediate range and make an Intellect roll. On a success, you erase up to the last five minutes of the creature’s memory. The creature forgets what it experienced during that time. Action.
        cost: [ 3, Intellect ]
      Far Step:
        desc: You leap through the air and land some distance away. You can jump up, down, or across to anywhere you choose within long range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to that location. You land safely. Action.
        cost: [ 2, Intellect ]
      Machine Interface:
        desc: The difficulty of discerning the level, function, and activation of powered numenera devices that you touch is decreased by one step for one minute. Enabler.
        cost: [ 2, Intellect ]
      Mental Link:
        desc: You open a pathway to another creature’s mind via a light touch, which allows you to transmit thoughts and images to each other. In other words, you can communicate with each other without having to speak. The mental link remains regardless of distance and lasts for one hour. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty of this esotery, you can apply Effort to extend the duration by one hour for each level of Effort. Action to initiate.
        cost: [ 1, Intellect ]
      Resonance Field:
        desc: Faint lines in a color you choose form a tracery over your entire body and emit faint light. The effect lasts for one minute. Whenever a creature within immediate range makes an attack against you, the pattern energizes to block the attack. You can make an Intellect defense roll in place of the defense roll you would normally make. If you do so and you get a minor effect, the creature attacking you takes 1 point of damage. If you get a major effect, the creature attacking you takes 4 points of damage. Action to initiate.
        cost: [ 1, Intellect ]
      Sculpt Flesh:
        desc: You cause a willing creature’s fingers to lengthen into claws and her teeth to grow into fangs by sculpting her flesh. The effect lasts for ten minutes. The damage dealt by the target’s unarmed strikes increases to 4 points. Action.

  background:
    Forbidden Knowledge: You understand the numenera far better than most people do. You know that it isn’t just strange machines buried in old ruins. The numenera is everywhere, beyond the perception of humans. You know that microscopic machines called nanites are threaded through every inch of the world, waiting to be activated. You know that satellites in orbit are broadcasting information, waiting for someone to access it. Having studied long and hard, learning the proper ways to tap into the forces all around you, you know how to activate these machines and make them do what you wish, at least in limited, specific ways. These uses of power are called esoteries. Through various tiny devices that you possess, which probably seem like magic charms to the uninitiated, you “conjure” energy. By accessing the datasphere transmitted across the world, you connect with machines—including the nanites—to change your environment.
    Psionics: You know that the world is filled with ancient machines and their creations. Some of them are visible, but many are not. It’s not just skill or knowledge that allows you to gain access to them. You have a psychic talent to interface with the machines to produce various effects. Some of these machines are secreted about your person, and others are infused into the environment of the Ninth World. You can’t conjure energy or warp matter on your own, but you have the rare and spectacular ability to control the invisible nano-machines that do it for you. Is this gift the natural result of extreme exposure to technology? Is it the fusion of the biological and the mechanical? Is it the design of a genius architect, generations earlier, who manipulated the genetics of your family? Or is it just a random mutation? In any case, you’re the natural synthesis of human and machine, working as one.
    Ports and Plugs: "You have a connection with machines for one clear reason: you’re practically a machine yourself. Your nervous system is laced with circuitry, and your body has implanted jacks and ports where you plug in modules and other technological bits that provide your capabilities. When you produce effects or manipulate nanites, you do so through your body’s direct mechanical interface. Your force blasts might come from a device implanted in your palm or fingertip. Your ability to tap into the datasphere might come from the receiver plugged into a port you built in the back of your neck. Obviously, to become a Nano, you have undergone numerous surgeries and procedures (either willingly or unwillingly). You are forever changed. Some people treat you with disdain or derision, but perhaps most of your modifications can be hidden by a hooded cloak or similar garment."
  intrusions:
    Advantageous Malfunction: A numenera device that is being used against you malfunctions. It might harm the user or one of their allies for a round, or activate a dramatic and distracting side effect for a few rounds.
    Convenient Glimmer: A glimmer provides you with a clear answer or suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re facing.
    Inexplicably Unbroken: An inactive, ruined, or presumed-destroyed device temporarily activates and performs a useful function relevant to the situation. This is enough to buy you some time for a better solution, alleviate a complication that was interfering with your abilities, or just get you one more use out of a depleted cypher or artifact.

        desc: A level 1 creature accompanies you and follows your instructions. This creature is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg) and is normally some sort of domesticated species. You and the GM must work out the details of your creature, and you’ll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. The critter companion acts on your turn.

      Link Senses:
        desc: You touch a willing creature and link its senses to yours for one minute.

      Phased Pocket:
        desc: You connect yourself for one hour to a small space that is out of phase and moves with you. You can access this space as if it were a convenient pocket or bag, but nobody else can perceive or access the space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space can hold up to 1 cubic foot. The space is a part of you, so you can’t use it to carry more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the space harms you, and so on. When the connection ends, anything in the space falls out. For each 2 additional Intellect points you spend, the pocket lasts an additional hour. Enabler.

        desc: When you spend a few hours in an inhabited urban environment about the size of a town or larger, the GM must tell you one rumor that pertains to the community.

    - You’re a member of a guild of explorers who specialize in uncovering ancient mysteries.
    - You worked alongside your father, who was skilled in many things, until he disappeared one day with no explanation.
    - You grew up on the streets and studied at the school of hard knocks.
    - You remember little of your past, which has always seemed strange to you.
    - You came of age in the wild and are used to living rough.
    - Your family is wealthy but earns little respect from the locals.
    - You’re friends with many people in the community and are generally well regarded.
    - You have an annoying rival who always seems to get in your way or foil your plans.
    - You’re in love with a local shopkeeper, but that person shows little interest in you.
    - Several expeditions preparing to explore old ruins and odd mysteries would like you to join them because you seem like a promising addition to the team.
    - Your best friend from childhood is now an Aeon Priest.
    - You come from a nearby community, but the locals consider the folk of your hometown to be untrustworthy rivals.
    - You’re close friends with a local married couple, both of whom are experienced nanos.
    - You’re drinking buddies with a number of the local guards and glaives.

    - You have a friend with an extensive library, plenty of food and drink, and a comfortable home—and the door is always open to you.
  backgrounds:
    Born Lucky: You seem to be better than most people because you are. Your ancestors were part of a genetic experiment, and your genes are superior to those of the average human. You’re smarter, stronger, more dexterous, and able to learn mental and physical skills more quickly. Folks might call you charismatic, blessed, divinely gifted, or just plain lucky. They probably said the same thing about your parents, their parents, and so on. Some of your genetic advantage might even grant you low-level psychic abilities that greatly resemble the “miracles” performed by Nanos.
    School of Hard Knocks: You learned things the hard way—on your own. Adaptive and canny, you express the true strengths of humanity in your ability to adjust quickly to circumstances, pick up new tricks to succeed, and ultimately survive when you probably should be dead. Most likely, you grew up on your own, perhaps on the streets, in the wilderness, or amid ruins. The details don’t really matter. What’s important is that you taught yourself how to overcome whatever challenges came along.
    A Cobbled Jumble: You’re the product of generations of eugenics, bolstered by minor cybernetic enhancements, a few small psychic abilities, and the lessons of secret masters. In other words, you don’t have one source of power or one explanation for your abilities—you have many, and as far as you’re concerned, that’s the best formula for success. You don’t put all your eggs in a single proverbial basket. To really get ahead, you must rely on multiple strengths. You’ve always got an unexpected trick up your sleeve or a fallback contingency. For example, you might have subdermal implants that make you more resilient, your training might let you sense a foe’s attack before he strikes, and your psychic abilities could allow you to push your enemy’s blade slightly to the left so you can just barely dodge it. In the end, you’re simply hard to hurt.
  intrusions:
    Familiar Insight: YOu know this person (or heard about them somehwere) well enough to give insight about their motives or intentions, and how best to convince them to see things your way. You know the right words, posturing, inflection, amount of emotional manipulation, or even what sort of joke or agreeable complaint might sway them. This can convince a neutral person to take your side, or a hostile one to hear you out for a little while longer.
    Inspirational Recall: You recall an important detail from a previous encounter (perhaps something you don’t even remember noticing at the time) that suggests a successful course of action for your current situation. This might be recognizing a password hidden in an innocuous code or riddle, realizing you saw a suspicious individual near a crime scene, overhearing an important conversation between two NPCs, or understanding that an NPC’s subtle glance or gesture had additional connotations indicating what you should do.
    Lucky Break: Something unexpected happens that is to your advantage. A rope your opponent is hanging from might snap, the person you’re debating in front of an influential Aeon Priest might trip or forget what they were going to say, or something that was supposed to last only a round or two lasts a little while longer.

      Anecdote:
        desc: You can lift the spirits of a group of creatures and help them bond together by entertaining them with an uplifting or pointed anecdote. For the next hour, those who pay attention to your story are trained in a task you choose that’s related to the anecdote, as long as it’s not an attack or defense task.

      Connection With an Organization:
        desc: You have a general connection with an important organization, such as the Order of Truth, the Angulan Knights, the aristocracy of a region, a merchant guild, and so on. Tasks related to interacting with members of that group gain an asset. Further, you can use this connection to learn about events related to that organization’s focus. For instance, if you have a connection with the Angulan Knights, you may learn of events related to mutants in the area. You and the GM should work out the details together. You can choose this ability more than once and choose a new organization each time. Enabler.
      Goad:
        desc: You can attempt to goad a target into a belligerent—and probably foolish—reaction that requires the target to try to close the distance between you and attempt to physically strike you on its next turn. They attempt this action even if this would cause them to break formation or to give up cover or a tactically superior position. Whether the target strikes you or fails to do so, they come to their senses immediately afterward, after which further tasks attempting to goad the target again are hindered. Action to initiate.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
      Powerful Rhetoric:
        desc: After engaging a creature in conversation for at least a minute, you can attempt to influence how that creature is perceived, promoting it as a friend, dismissing it as a fool, or denouncing it as an enemy. Your words are so well chosen that even you and it are affected, because your conviction and its doubt are paramount. The accuracy of your assessment isn’t important as long as you keep up the rhetoric. From then on (or until you change your rhetoric or the creature offers a convincing defense to those who’ve heard your label), the friend’s social interactions gain an asset, the fool’s social interactions are hindered, or the enemy’s defenses are hindered. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.

  background:
    Inborn Traits: You were born this way. Everyone always took to you. You always seemed to know the right thing to say. It all came naturally. Your voice was pleasant, your eyes shining and honest, and your face attractive. These qualities have always been strong enough that you could rely on them. While others studied a craft, learned to fight or steal, or tinkered with the numenera, you found that you could usually get what you needed and wanted by talking to people. Now, all this might come from a heritage of quality forebears, or it could come from something more. A silver-tongued Arkus like yourself might have inherited these qualities from your family, or you might benefit from subtle mutations that alter your voice and mannerisms to be perfect for influencing others. You don’t really know. You just know that you’ve always been this way and that, while you look just like everyone else, you’re different. Of course, no one ever need know that but you.
    Enhancements: You might be a leader, but you don’t fit the mold. Although you gained your share of practical experience in learning how to influence others, you have the numenera on your side as well. Some of your knowledge of rhetoric and ability to speak at an enhanced volume is due to biomechanical bits implanted in your brain and spine, wired into your nerves and muscles. Your vocal cords are woven with subtle resonant threads. Subdermal plating makes your appearance more symmetrical and pleasing. Your facial muscles are interlaced with small elements that give you complete control over your micro expressions. Alternatively, your genetic code could have been rewritten by engineered viruses, or the tissues in your body could have been reworked by nanotech, turning you into a paragon that others are drawn to. Or maybe you’ve been altered by strange science—radioactive treatments of bizarre energies, chemical compounds and drugs, or extradimensional enhancements—that makes you smarter and more able to see the implications of long-term planning than anyone around you. Whatever the case, you’re the result of ancient knowledge made manifest in the present, and now you’re shaping the future. Perhaps your modifications are obvious and visible; perhaps they’re not. Regardless, you know that you’re more than merely human.
    Training and Experience: You are eloquent, good-looking, or both, but what really separates you from the crowd is your training. Perhaps you worked as an intern with the Aeon Priests in Qi that work behind the scenes to lead the Order of Truth, where they taught you how to speak eloquently, debate convincingly, and synthesize the best plans from all those put forth. You know a thousand different ways to argue and influence. You learned how to read people to ascertain their moods, distinguish their truths from their lies, and determine what they want and what they need to hear. You got a lot of practice using your skills in public, starting small at first but working your way up to leading community movements and taking charge of short-term community projects.
  intrusions:
    Friendly NPC: An NPC you don’t know, someone you don’t know that well, or someone you know but who hasn’t been particularly friendly in the past chooses to help you, though doesn’t necessarily explain why. Maybe they’ll ask you for a favor in return afterward, depending on how much trouble they go to.
    Perfect Suggestion: A follower or other already-friendly NPC suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle you’re facing.
    Unexpected Gift: An NPC hands you a physical gift you were not expecting, one that helps put the situation at ease if things seem strained, or provides you with a new insight for understanding the context of the situation if there’s something you’re failing to understand or grasp.

    Community Ability:
      Builder:
        desc: [*community, +3 is added to the community's infrastrcture. Enabler]
    Always Tinkering:
      desc: If you have any tools or materials at all, and you are carrying fewer cyphers than your limit, you can create a cypher if you have an hour of time to spend. The new cypher is random and always 2 levels lower than normal (minimum 1). It's also tempermental and fragile. There are called tempermental cyphers. If you give it to anyone else to you, it falls apart immediately, useless. Action to initate, one hour to complete.
    Numenera Plans:
      desc: You start with two numenera plans of yhour choice. Enabler

  chooseable:
    amt: 2
    skills:
      Additional Numenera Plans:
        desc: You gain two additional numenera plans. You can take this ability multiple times. Enabler.
      Deconstruct:
        desc: You take the time to closely study a bit of scrap, machine, cypher, artifact, or other numenera object or structure before attempting to salvage iotum from it. If the salvage source possesses iotum that can be salvaged (as determined by the GM), the salvage task gains an asset. In addition, you gain one additional iotum from the salvage attempt, which means one additional roll on the Iotum Result Table. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete.
        cost: [3, Intellect]
      Extra Use:
        desc: You attempt to gain an extra use from an installation or artifact without triggering a depletion roll. The difficulty of the task is equal to the level of the installation or artifact. If you crafted the installation or artifact, you gain an asset to the task. On a failure, the depletion roll occurs normally. You could also try to use a cypher without burning it out, but the task is hindered. A failed attempt to gain an additional use from a cypher destroys it before it can produce the desired effect. Action.
        cost: [3, Intellect]
      Natural Crafter:
        desc: All commonplace objects or structures you craft are effectively 1 level higher than an average example of that object or structure. For instance, if you craft a defensive wall that would normally be level 4, its effective level is 5. Enabler.
      Right Tool for the Job:
        desc: If you have at least 1 unit of iotum, you can fashion a temporary device that provides an asset to one physical, noncombat task, identified ahead of time. For example, if you need to climb a wall, you could create some sort of climbing assistance device; if you need to break out of a cell, you can tune iotum in your possession to serve as a lockpick; if you need to create a small distraction, you could trigger an iotum to make a loud bang and flash; and so on. Once fashioned, the adapted iotum lasts for about a minute or until used for the intended purpose. This use destroys the iotum. Action to prepare the iotum; action to initiate.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
        iotum_appending: 1
      Scan for Iotum:
        desc: Using a device or some kind of unique sense, you scan an area equal in size to a 10-foot (3 m) cube, including all objects or structures. The area must be within immediate range. The difficulty of the task is equal to the level of the object or structure being scanned. Scanning in this fashion grants an asset to initial salvage tasks in the area to determine if anything is worth salvaging. This ability doesn’t improve your ability to find a specific kind of iotum, only to discover whether there is iotum within the salvage source in the first place. That said, many materials and energy fields prevent or resist scanning. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Scramble Machine:
        desc: You render one machine within short range unable to function for one round. Alternatively, you can hinder any action by the machine (or by someone attempting to use the machine) for one minute. Action.
        cost: [2, Intellect]
      Trained in Armor:
        desc: You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You can wear any kind of armor. You reduce the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor by 1. If you choose this as one of your starting inspired techniques, you start the game with armor of your choice. Enabler.
      Trigger Iotum Ray:
        desc: If you have at least 1 unit of iotum, you can trigger it to release a shortrange ray of force that inflicts 3 points of damage. This does not destroy the iotum. Alternatively, you can choose to have this destroy the iotum, in which case there is no Intellect cost. Action.
        cost: [1, Intellect]
        iotum_substitute: 1
  background:
      Unusual Upbringing: From a very early age, you had access to machines and tools, and you were encouraged to learn how to use them. Perhaps you were raised by a Nano or an Aeon Priest who thought building was more important than playing. Maybe your parents were obsessed with the numenera. Or perchance you were incubated and trained by machines who needed human ingenuity and creativity to solve a problem they couldn’t overcome. You stacked gears and circuits instead of wooden blocks, and your earliest drawings were schematics for toys you wanted to build. Your bedtime stories were about automatons, nanites, and electronics, and your dreams were filled with the wondrous things you would create with an endless supply of iotum and parts. When you grew older and prepared to set out on your own, you asked those who raised you what great work you could build for them as thanks for what they taught you—something contributing to their research, a device to overcome an infirmity, or even a new self-willed automaton to  join them. Now you search for a suitable plan, the iotum to craft it, or both.
      Unexpected Brilliance: "Your mind developed early, way before your peers. Your parents realized it and delighted in challenging you with puzzles and projects. You could fix household items, and eventually you found your true passion: taking apart oddities, scrap, and depleted cyphers. You figured out how to make broken machines work again, and honed your ability to recognize what a jumble of parts could do if you put them together in just the right configuration. Most people respected and appreciated your talent, some tried to exploit you, and a few feared you, but your incredible mind made sure you always came out ahead—or gave you enough of a head start to get away from serious trouble. Whence did your brilliance spring? Just an accident of nurture and nature? Did you have a great-grandparent who was equally skilled? Or is your facility with objects and structures something inherent in you, such as a mutation in your brain that gives you insights that others can’t imagine? It’s a mystery, and one you’d like 	to solve one day. But only after you finish your current list of crafting projects."
      Mechanical Indoctrination: The Prophecy was clear. If the machine that squatted at the center of town could not be awoken by midnight during the next eclipse, the Spear of God would strike like a burning sword from the void and blast everyone and everything to drit. You were one of the ones selected to awaken the Red Cube. You were schooled, drilled, and cypher-fed all manner of information, plans, knowledge, and even some physical know-how dripped into your blood by strange machines the city elders kept in dark basements. Others who were selected weakened and eventually died under the brutal regime of learning. It was rough on you, too, but where so many others failed, you succeeded. You learned. And with that knowledge, you repaired the machine and saved the city. But in the aftermath, you were different, both physically and psychologically. You weren’t taught how to craft things— it was programmed into you, hard-coded into your flesh and mind with drugs and technology, conditioned into your psyche with rep titive drills. You don’t know if the motivations of your captors/doctors/ instructors were noble or nefarious, but the end result is that building things is as natural for you as breathing. You can assemble basic components when you’re half asleep just by using muscle memory. You may even have subdermal implants that convert nutrition and bodily wastes into components you need. You  might feel like you were robbed of a normal childhood, or you might celebrate your strange education and embrace opportunities to learn and experience childish things with adult senses and intellect. In some ways, you are an organic machine built to create and repair other machines, but your skills are what allow you to survive and thrive in the Ninth World. Your goal may be to destroy those who created  you, better understand their motives, or push  orward their agenda.
  intrusions:
      Device Perfection: A device or installation works even better than you expected it would, at least in this instance. Maybe the range is twice as long, the duration is 100% longer, or the effect itself is 50% stronger.
      Crafting Insight: You are inspired, and you  finish crafting the object or structure earlier than was expected (maybe even halving the total time).
      Tinkering Vision: When using your Always Tinkering special ability, you discover that the materials you’re using are of unexpectedly high quality, giving you specific options to choose from. So instead of gaining a random cypher, you gain the cypher of your choice (though it’s still a temperamental cypher, so it’s 2 levels lower than normal and you can’t give it to someone else without destroying it).

        option: [ navigation, perception, sensing danger, initiative, peacefully opening communications with strangers, and tracking. ]
      Familiarize:
        desc: "You can familiarize yourself with a new area if you spend at least one hour studying a region up to a long distance across that you are able to directly access and move about in. Once you’ve familiarized yourself with an area, all your tasks related to perception, navigation, salvaging, defense, and moving about the area gain an asset. Each time you familiarize yourself with a new area, you lose focus on a previous area unless you spend 1 XP to retain the familiarity permanently. Action to initiate, one hour to complete. Find the Way: When you apply Effort to a navigation task because you don’t know the way, are lost, are attempting to blaze a new route, need to choose between two or more otherwise similar paths to take, or something very similar, you can apply a free level of effort. Enabler."
      Right Tool for the Job:
        desc: If you have at least 1 unit of iotum, you can fashion a temporary device that provides an asset to a physical, non-combat task (identified ahead of time). For example, if you need to climb a wall, you could create some sort of climbing assistance device; if you need to break out of a cell, you can tune iotum in your possession to serve as a lockpick; if you need to create a small distraction, you could trigger an iotum to make a loud bang and flash; and so on. Once fashioned, the adapted iotum lasts for about a minute or until used for the intended purpose. This use destroys the iotum. Action to prepare the iotum; action to initiate.

        desc: You are trained in Speed defense tasks when not wearing armor. Enabler.
  background:
    What Others Fear to Know: Your knowledge of what underlies the numenera is a degree beyond what even most Aeon Priests and Nanos know. Some see it as devilry and ill magic, believing it is knowledge that should remain in the ruins of the past. Mimetic gel, tamed iron, kaon dots, and even data orbs are things that you understand because you found them and were taught by them in turn. The tamed iron nearly killed you because, as you know, it’s a cousin to the iron wind. The data orb was almost your death, because when you connected it to the datasphere, an automaton was dispatched to your location as a security measure. But you survived and learned yet more in the process. In fact, you learned to disassemble both the active devices and the long-dead machines of the prior worlds in order to salvage that which gave them form and substance. This iotum, you learned, was a completely new source of wonder and knowledge.
    Part Machine: "Is it any wonder you can take apart other devices and machines when you’re at least half mechanical yourself? Your connection with machines is obvious: modules, ports, and other strange tech protrudes from your skin, hinting at deeper connections beneath. Perhaps your skin is shiny or metallic, or maybe it has a coating that absorbs light. You can find your way deeper into ruins of the prior worlds at least partially because you can open ways that others can’t with just a touch. When you salvage iotum from dead cyphers and scrap, you do so by commanding nanites through your ports. Your abilities are at least partially derived from the hidden devices that lace your nervous system. Sometimes, you wonder if the components and iotum that you salvage from other machines also lie within you. How you came to be part machine is a story all its own. Were you always like this? Did you fall into a ruin and  wake up this way? Did you undergo surgeries offered by a strange entity, taking a chance on becoming something more? However it happened, you’re not human, and commoners sometimes look upon you with fear and  uspicion. That’s all right, as long as another Delve doesn’t look upon you as a potential source for components. Sometimes, rather than worry about it, you hide your true nature beneath concealing garments or a hood."
    Mentor: "You grew up in service to another Delve from whom you learned to train your stamina, patience, and love for the weird. You were taught not to fear things that would make most people weak, sick, or outright dead. Instead, you cherish them as part of a life steeped in discovery. Your mentor taught you to love the wilderness, the unknown, and places of ancient power, in particular—exactly the opposite of how most are raised in the Ninth World. After a time, you and your mentor parted ways—perhaps due to a philosophical disagreement, a scarcity of resources, arare opportunity requiring travel, or some kind of tragedy.  Sometimes you wonder, as you gaze at some new amazing, impossible edifice: what would your mentor think of this?"
  intrusions:
    Fortuitous Malfunction: A trap or a dangerous device malfunctions before it can affect you.
    Serendipitous Landmark: Just when it seems like the path is lost, or you are, a trail marker, landmark, or simply the way the terrain or corridor bends, rises, or falls away suggests to you the best path forward, at least from this point.
    Weak Strain: The poison or disease turns out not to be as debilitating or deadly as it first seemed, and inflicts only half the damage that it would have otherwise.
  connections:
    - You always seem to run into another delve when you explore. Sometimes they help, but sometimes they take the best a ruin has to offer and leave you with drit.
    - A merchant in a nearby city is always asking you for rare and wondrous items, which you’re pretty sure they resell for a far higher price than they ever give you.
    - One of your parents was a minor official, with access to many privileges and much information.
    - Your sibling became a glaive and now serves with a traveling band of specimen collectors in the employ of some organization whose name you can never remember.
    - Before becoming a full-time explorer, you sometimes sang in taverns for your meals. You even created a few songs that are still sung by other balladeers.
    - The town you grew up in was destroyed in a disaster that involved a flock of brilliant spheres of light that burst from the earth and rose into the sky, each taking a portion of the town away.
    - You were taken into slavery as a child but later escaped. You still have scars and bad dreams.
    - The Amber Gleaners have been attempting to recruit you, but so far you’ve put them off.
    - You owe money to a number of people and don’t have the funds to pay your debts. Nobody seems interested in taking iotum.
    - You ran with bandits for a short period, but you left them after thinking better of it. Now, however, they are after you, swearing that no one leaves their group while still breathing.
    - You taught children for many years, but those days are behind you now.
    - As an orphan, you had a difficult childhood, and your entry into adulthood was challenging.
    - You led a double life. Most people know you as a conscientious and daring explorer, but you led another life as a thrill-seeking thief. You don’t indulge much in the latter anymore, but you sometimes dream about your lost cache of “trophies.”
    - You led a popular uprising in the town where you grew up, and you won. The old leaders were exiled.
    - You were married, but your partner was stolen by transdimensional beings.
    - The Order of Truth cut you from the ranks when you consistently failed to finish the tasks they set before you, but you claim it was because your supervisor failed to tell you what those tasks actually were.
    - As an envoy working in a distant city, you made friends that you still miss today.
    - You had a pet that you loved dearly, but it was killed in an accident. You’re still searching for how that accident came to be; could it have been a deliberate act by your enemies?
    - You were best friends with a nano, possibly even lovers, but the iron wind took them away from you.
    - You’ve often been maligned for your looks. Ungainly, different, of a different species or cultural background—the reason you look different than others is up to you.

          desc: If you have a conversation with someone (lasting at least a minute), you can get that someone to give you some information you desire during the course of the conversation. If this information is extremely secret or vital, the difficulty may be higher than simply their level (likewise, if it is not very vital, it might be lower). Best of all, if you are successful, the person either doesn’t realize the information slipped out, or they are not alarmed that they gave it to you. Enabler.
          cost: [ 1, Intellect ]
        Connection With an Organization:
          desc: You have a general connection with an important organization, such as the Order of Truth, the Angulan Knights, the Twelfth Ode (a criminal gang), the aristocracy of the region, a merchant guild, and so on. The difficulty of all tasks related to interacting with members of that group is decreased by one step. Further, you can use this connection to get help, lower prices on goods, or whatever is appropriate. You and the GM should work out the details together. You can choose this ability more than once, and choose a new organization each time. Enabler.
        Contact:
          desc: You have an important contact who is in an influential position, such as a minor noble, the captain of the town guard, an Aeon Priest, or the head of a large gang of thieves. You and the GM should work out the details together. You can choose this ability more than once, and gain a new contact each time. Enabler.
        Encouragement:
          desc: 'While you maintain this ability through ongoing inspiring oration, your allies within short range modify the difficulty of one of the following task types (your choice) by one step to their benefit: defense tasks, attack tasks, or tasks related to any skill that you are trained or specialized in. Action.'
          cost: [ 1, Intellect ]
        Fast Talk:
          desc: When speaking with an intelligent creature who can understand you and isn’t hostile, you convince that creature to take one reasonable action in the next round. A reasonable action should not put the creature or its allies in obvious danger or be wildly out of character, but it might be more than could be accomplished with a simple persuasion task. Action.
          cost: [ 1, Intellect ]
        Friendship:
          desc: You convince a sentient creature to regard you positively, as they would a potential friend. You gain an asset in all future interactions with the creature until you give them a reason to no longer regard you well, at which point this effect ends (and may result in the difficulty of future interactions increasing by one step, because scorn is a powerful emotion). The affected creature isn’t “charmed” supernaturally—they are not compelled or controlled in any way. A target affected by this is simply more likely to perceive you as a friend if you give them a reason to believe this to be so. This isn’t enough to keep a hostile foe from attacking, but it can help in a subsequent interaction task to do that.
          cost: [ 1, Intellect ]
        Influence:
          desc: You can, at a later date (in the course of play), leverage influence over an individual or even a group. Using this influence, the difficulty of tasks related to interacting with this individual or group is decreased by three steps. However, onceyou declare whom you have influence with,  you cannot change it unless you select this ability again when you gain a new tier. Further, depending on the circumstances that you and the GM work out, the influence may be temporary. For example, you might have incriminating evidence over the mayor of a city about his lurid romantic affair with the chief constable. However, if that affair ends, so does your influence. Enabler.
    background:
      Genetics: You were born this way. Everyone always took to you. You always seemed to know the right thing to say. It all came naturally. Your voice was pleasant, your eyes shining and honest, your face attractive. These qualities have always been strong enough that you could rely on them. While others learned a craft, or learned to fight, steal, or tinker with the numenera, you found that you could usually get what you needed, and what you wanted, by talking to people. It wasn’t necessarily a con—you liked talking as well as listening, and did that better than anyone else. Now, all this might just come from a heritage of quality forebears, but it could come from something more. A silvertongued Glint like yourself might have inherited those qualities from your family or you might even benefit from some subtle mutations that alter your voice and mannerisms to be perfect for influencing others. You don’t really know. You just know that you’ve always been this way, and that while you look just like everyone else, you’re different. Of course, no one ever need know that but you.
      Enhancements: Not everything is as it seems. You have numenera components—cybernetic implants or biomechanical modifications that have an intelligence all their own. These components help you determine the right thing to say. They analyze the expressions, gestures, and words of everyone you talk to and provide insights into their mood, reactions, honesty, and vulnerabilities. This all comes to you as second nature—these things are a part of you and have been for quite some time. You are as much a product of the numenera as you are of nature.
      Training and Experience: You showed plenty of aptitude on your own, but you really began to shine when a mentor took notice of you. Your mentor taught you how to speak and how to listen. From your mentor, you learned how to “read” people to ascertain their moods, distinguish their truths from their lies, and learn what they need and what they need to hear. Your mentor frequently took you out to practice your skills in public. You became more than

      Trained Without Armor:
        desc: You are trained in Speed defense tasks when not wearing armor. Enabler.
    background:
      Strange Experience: When you were younger, you had a strange  experience that you have not been able to fully understand. Somehow you found yourself in a mysterious location surrounded by the numenera and the trappings of some prior world. You no longer remember everything that happened, but you were bathed with strange energies. Were there other creatures there as well? It’s unclear. Somehow, you escaped and wound up once again in familiar surroundings. You’d like to find that place again and get some answers, but in the meantime there’s no denying that the experience changed you in some ways, both physically and psychologically. You don’t fear such places anymore—you look for them. Such places hold secrets, and that’s what you’re after now.
      Unnatrual Fortitude: Thanks to one of your ancestors, you have a stamina (both physically and psychologically) that most people can’t imagine. The things that would make most people weak, sick, or outright dead don’t affect you (or at least don’t affect you as strongly). Terrors no one would ever face are things you will confront head-on. You have your inherent nature to thank for that. It is effectively a mutation, due to something that happened to one of your forebears. Perhaps they were an explorer and wandered somewhere they should not have. They survived, however, and it created traits that have passed down to you. (Do your siblings or other relatives have some or all of the same traits or is it a mutation that shows up more randomly? You’ve wondered this in the past— perhaps you’ll find the answer one day.)
      A Unique Attitude: You were born different. Growing up, your elders tried to instill within you a good, healthy fear of the wilderness, the unknown, and in particular places of ancient power. But none of that made sense to you. You didn’t fear those things. You craved them. It’s not that you have a death wish; it’s that you know that for all the risks, there are great rewards. Something—some little voice deep inside you—assures you that if you look hard enough, delve deep enough, and explore far enough, you’ll find the power to make your dreams come true, the secret to everlasting life, or even greater treasures.
