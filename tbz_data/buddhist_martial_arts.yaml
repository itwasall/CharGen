    effect:
      - This allows for a split-second but extremely risky counterattack, reading the enemy's movements beofre their attack lands. The side which ends up losing the attack (the one with fewer successes) is treated as if they had 0 successes for that attack. This results in a devastating amount of damage to the attacker (or defender, if their split-second counterattack is not performed precisely). This technique can only be used when the monk is being attacked (as a defense), not when attacking.
      - Unarmed Combat damage increases to +4
