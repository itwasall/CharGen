oni_resonance:
  Alu:
    ability: Empathy
    desc: Alu is the almost telepathic spiritual ability of the oni people. If the target is an oni or half-oni, both parties can communicate through telepathy, called 'Heart-Speak' or 'Heart-Speech'. This can be done with very little effort. However, if the target is not an oni, thoughts can be sent to the target, butthe target's thoughts and responses cannot be read. Heart-Speech usually has a range of sight, but there are tales of oni paragons communicating over great distances
    Skilled:
      soul_cost: 1
      desc: The oni can participate in heart-speech. The effects will last for a scene
    Advanced:
      soul_cost: 2
      desc: The oni can participate in heart speech with animals other than oni, including humans, animals and even plants. When used with humans, thoughts can only be sent, not received. The effects will last for a scene
    Master:
      soul_cost: 3
      desc: "The oni can read the thoughts of animals other than oni, including humans, and also plants. If the target denies the connection, a contested action must be resolved agaist the target's Spirit: Willpower. If this power is used with the Advanced level Alu skill, a sort of two-way pseudo-heart-speed can be achieved with humans. The effects will last for a scene"
    Supreme:
      soul_cost: 5
      desc: "The oni can directly attack a target's mind. The oni engages the target in a contested action against the target's Spirit: Willpower. If the oni succeeds, the difference by which they succeeded can be inflicted on the target's vitality as damage. If the oni fails, there is no effect"
  Dii:
    ability: Body
    desc: "Dii's a connection with the land, and manifests in a kind of telekinesis. It allows the user to move objects by borrowing the power of the gossamer-like force known as Sha. Sha is a force spread through the land of Tenra like wispy, always-moving sheets of invisible raw power. When Dii is used to inflict damage directly, a contested action against the target's Spirit: Willpower is necessary. The difference in the success values are applied as damage. When this damage is from a collision with a quickly moving object, it is treated as per the rules for ranged weapons and can be evaded or parried. The oni using this ability to damage an opponent must spend Soul according to the table below. Dii utilises the following powers, depending on the level of resonance. Each power lasts for one minute (one round) but the oni can spend the ability's Soul cost again to keep the power active for each extra minute. The GM may add more damage to a successful resonance attack with a heavier object, depending on the situation."
