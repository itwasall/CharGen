    fate: [Kongohki, Sealed Memory]
    desc: Kongohki are made from binding the soul of an asura (a soul who died under extreme stress or Karma and did not move on to the afterlife) inside a meikyo soul mirror. The violent soul of the asura is harnessed in a very delicate procedure which ends up suppressing all of its memories. It is this tormented soul that gives the kongohki its strength. However, if this balance deteriorates, you will remember your former identity, and likely go crazy (or become an asura again) in the process
    notes: "At character creation you have the following attribute scores: Body 7, Agility 9, Senses 9 and 22 points to spend on other attributes. You cannot add or subtract points from those three attributes at character creation"

    desc: Kimen Kongohki are made from wiping the memories of a fallen Asura soul, then binding it into a kimenkyo calculation engine.

When the soul manifests itself, the kimen kongohki can still fly into a powerful rage or other emotional state.
