Test1:
    Cost: 1m 
    Mins: [(Archery, 2), (Essence, 1)]
    Type: Supplemental
    Keywords: Uniform
    Duration: Instant
    Prerequisite Charms: None
    Description: With skill and effort, the Exalt guides her arrow to its mark. The Exalt may use this Charm to supplement a withering or decisive attack, reducing the benefits of cover. The defense bonus of heavy and light cover is reduced by one, while characters under no cover suffer a -1 penalty to their normal Defense.  In addition, after taking an aim action, the Solar may activate this Charm to strike an opponent in full cover. The Exalt shoots along an arc or angle that perfectly matches her opponent's position. So long as there is some opening where an arrow can get through, Wise Arrow treats a character in full cover as if he merely has +3 Defense.

Test2:
    Cost: 1m 
    Mins: [[Archery, 3], [Essence, 1]]
    Type: Reflexive
    Keywords: None
    Duration: One tick
    Prerequisite Charms: Wise Arrow
    Description: The Exalt opens her eyes not to the visual world, but to the world of Essence, sensing her target in that fashion.  She may make an Archery attack without penalties for visual conditions. Smoke, fog, and pitch darkness are no longer a problem for her, though other factors such as high winds and cover still apply against the attack.  At Archery 5+, Essence 3+, the Solar can momentarily see through cover, perceiving her targets as silhouettes the colors of bright anima.
